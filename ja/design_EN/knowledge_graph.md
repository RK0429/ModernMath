# Building a Full-Scale Mathematical Knowledge Graph from Scratch

## Overview and Goals

Creating an evolving wiki of mathematical knowledge as a **knowledge graph** requires careful planning. The goal is to represent the entire landscape of mathematics as interconnected nodes of **axioms, definitions, theorems, and examples**. This allows users (and machines) to query relationships (e.g., which theorems depend on a specific axiom) and discover new connections. Each piece of knowledge will be written as a human-readable document in **Quarto** (as `.qmd` files) while simultaneously feeding a machine-readable graph. Ultimately, the system aims to support **interactive queries**, publish the data as **Linked Data**, and embed dynamic **visualizations** into the Quarto pages for readers. This is an ambitious scope, essentially a semantic wiki for mathematics, but recent projects have shown its feasibility. For example, the MaRDI project has built a comprehensive mathematical knowledge graph on the Wikibase platform (a customized Wikipedia) to link definitions, formulas, and research data. Our approach, instead, will build the graph from scratch using our own tools and automation pipelines.

## Knowledge Graph Design: Nodes and Relationships

First, we define the **schema** of our knowledge graph—what kinds of nodes and edges (relationships) it will contain.

* **Node Types:** The core node types are **Axiom**, **Definition**, **Theorem** (including lemmas, propositions, and corollaries), and **Example**. Each node corresponds to a Quarto page describing that item. (Optionally, we could include **Proof** nodes for each theorem's proof, which can help avoid circular dependencies, but for simplicity, we can also treat proofs as text attached to theorem nodes.)
* **Attributes:** Each node will have attributes such as a unique ID, a title (e.g., "Definition: Group"), a human-readable statement (the content of the Quarto page), and potentially a formal statement (if encoded in formal logic or a structured logical form).
* **Relationships:** We define directed edges to capture logical and educational relationships.
  * *"Uses" / "Depends on":* A link from a theorem to the definitions, axioms, or previous theorems used in its proof. For example, a theorem node might have an edge to the definition nodes of the concepts it assumes. This creates a dependency graph of results that build on preceding ones.
  * *"Defines":* A link from a definition node to the concept it defines (or we could treat the concept itself as a node, but it's often sufficient to consider it labeled by the concept name within the definition node).
  * *"Has example":* A link from a definition or theorem to an example node that illustrates it. Conversely, an example node could link to the concept or theorem it exemplifies.
  * *"Specializes" or "Generalizes":* Optional links to capture hierarchical relationships (e.g., one axiom is a special case of another, or one theorem generalizes another).
  * *"Implies":* A special relationship for the logical implication ("if-then") inherent in many theorems and axioms. In fact, many mathematical statements can be seen as implications. As one author noted, *"definitions, axioms, and theorems can be stated in if/then sentences that build on each other."* While we can express the content of a theorem as a logical implication between a hypothesis and a conclusion, for the graph, we don't necessarily need to store the full logical form; dependency links are often sufficient. Still, the transitive nature of the "implies" relationship means that chains of these relationships allow for the discovery of indirect connections.
* **Ontology and Linked Data:** Since we want to achieve Linked Data, we should formalize these node types and relationships in an ontology (e.g., using RDF/OWL). We can define classes like `math:Axiom`, `math:Theorem`, and properties like `math:uses`, `math:proves`, `math:hasExample`. We can draw inspiration from existing ontologies like **OntoMathPRO**, which is an ontology of mathematical knowledge providing a semantic schema for concepts, theorems, etc., aiming for integration into the Web of Data. Adopting or mapping to such an ontology would make our graph more interoperable. However, we can start simply with a custom schema, ensuring each item has a stable URI (for Linked Data).
* **Granularity – Theorem vs. Proof:** We need to consider how to handle proofs. One approach (used in some discussions of dependency graphs) is to treat each **Proof** as a node in its own right, which *uses* certain preceding results and *produces* a theorem. This can avoid directed cycles that might arise if Theorem A and Theorem B can be proven assuming each other (the proofs form intermediate nodes). Implementing proof nodes is more complex, so we might omit this initially and assume that theorem dependencies form a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based on a chosen order of development. However, we should be mindful of such edge cases.

By designing the graph schema upfront, we ensure that as new content is added, it fits consistently into the knowledge graph. Every Quarto page will effectively instantiate one of these types of nodes, and every time we reference one page from another, we will be defining an edge in the graph.

## Content Creation with Quarto

Quarto serves as the **frontend for content creation**—the "wiki" where we write our axioms, definitions, theorems, and examples in cleanly formatted Markdown. Organizing the content systematically will effectively facilitate graph construction.

* **File Structure:** It's wise to give each concept or statement its own file (node). For example, we could have a folder structure like `axioms/`, `definitions/`, `theorems/`, `examples/`, or organize by mathematical topic (algebra, analysis, etc.) in subfolders. A consistent file naming convention (or an ID in each file's metadata) will help ensure each node is uniquely identifiable.
* **Using Quarto's Cross-Referencing:** Quarto supports cross-references for internal links and theorem-like environments. Each `.qmd` file will have a title and can link to other files. In practice, *"each concept has its own file,"* and notes are hyperlinked to each other. For example, if we have `group.qmd` defining a group and `example_group.qmd` with an example of a group, we would place a link to the example on the definition page and vice-versa. Quarto renders these as hyperlinks in the HTML output. By consistently linking to other concepts we reference, we are essentially building the graph's edges within the text. Quarto's cross-reference syntax (using `@label` for theorems, definitions, etc.) can also automatically generate numbered labels and hyperlinks. For example, if a target has the identifier `{#def-group}`, we can write `@def-group` to refer to the definition of a group elsewhere. Leveraging this feature makes the links explicit and easier to parse later.
* **Metadata in YAML:** We can include metadata about the node in the YAML front matter of each Quarto file. For example:

    ```yaml
    title: "Definition: Group"
    type: "Definition"
    id: "def-group"
    requires: ["axiom-choice", "def-set"]  # Optional: list of prerequisite IDs
    ```

    This is a hypothetical example, but adding `type` and `id` fields would help our automation scripts. Quarto will ignore custom fields it doesn't use, but a Python script can read them. A `requires` field (or similar) could be manually maintained to list dependencies, but ideally, most relationships will be collected from links in the content. Still, metadata is useful for things that aren't easily parsed.
* **Writing Style:** When mentioning a concept or result, we should always reference it (either by linking or at least using a consistent name) so the graph can pick it up. For example, writing in a theorem's proof, "...using **Lemma @lem-somelemma**, we find that..." both informs the reader and gives the parser something to grab (the link `@lem-somelemma` can later be extracted as the relationship "this theorem uses that lemma"). If references are purely textual, it might require an NLP step (or an LLM) to infer the link, but this is harder to automate reliably. Therefore, part of the writing convention for this wiki should be to *always link to the page of any concept or result you use*. This way, the knowledge graph is essentially woven manually, just expressed in text.

In summary, Quarto becomes the collaborative authoring environment for our mathematical content. Each Quarto node is written in a human-readable way (with LaTeX equations, etc.) while also having the necessary hooks (links, IDs, metadata) for the backend to build the graph.

## Backend Graph Construction (Python and Lean Integration)

Once we have the content, we need to **extract the graph structure** and store it in a queryable format. Python is an excellent choice for this backend data processing. We can also integrate **Lean4** for formalization and validation where possible.

**1. Parsing Quarto Output:** One approach is to parse the *rendered HTML* of the Quarto site to extract links and structured data. Quarto generates an HTML page for each `.qmd`. Using the Python library **BeautifulSoup** to parse these pages is effective. This is similar to how one project parsed Lean's HTML documentation. In that project, they compiled Lean's math library using a documentation generation tool, and then *"the documentation of mathlib4 contains all mathematical objects... to extract information such as names, hierarchical relationships, and descriptions, the Python library BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML and convert it into JSON."* We can do the same. For each HTML page (node), we would collect its title, type, and all hyperlinks to other pages within it. Each hyperlink from page A to page B (if it points to another mathematical item in our wiki) becomes a relationship in the graph. The type of that relationship might be inferred from the context or the types of the nodes (e.g., if A is a theorem and it links to B, which is a definition, it likely means A *uses* B in its proof or statement).

* Alternatively, we could parse the raw `.qmd` Markdown files directly. Markdown is somewhat easier to parse for links (with regex or a Markdown AST). However, Quarto's cross-reference syntax (`@label`) might be difficult to resolve without letting Quarto render it. A compromise would be to use Quarto's built-in site JSON or other export features if available. (Quarto might have an option to output a list of cross-references or a sitemap; if not, parsing HTML is fine.)
* If we leverage YAML metadata like `requires: [...]`, we can also parse the front matter with a YAML parser (e.g., PyYAML) to get declared edges directly. This can supplement the links found in the text.

**2. Building the Graph Data Structure:** As we parse, we build the graph. We could use an in-memory structure (like Python's NetworkX) or build directly for a database. For Linked Data, we would prefer to build **RDF triples**. Using Python's **rdflib** library, we can easily define triples and serialize them to Turtle or JSON-LD. For example, if `Theorem T` uses `Definition D`, we could add the triple `(math:T, math:uses, math:D)`. Each node would also have a triple asserting its type, e.g., `math:T rdf:type math:Theorem`. If each node has a unique ID or URI (which can be based on the page name or a GUID), we use those as the subject/object identifiers. In the end, we will have a collection of triples representing all the extracted relationships.

If we prefer a property graph or need complex queries, an option is to use a graph database like **Neo4j**. In the Lean mathlib example, after parsing the JSON, *"Python is employed to construct a knowledge graph, which is eventually stored in a Neo4j graph database."* We could do something similar. Using Neo4j's Python driver (or py2neo), we would upload the nodes and relationships. Neo4j allows querying with its Cypher query language. However, since publishing Linked Data is a goal, an RDF triplestore might align more with standard Linked Data practices than Neo4j. (Neo4j has RDF plugins, but sticking to a pure RDF environment might simplify publication.)

**3. Lean4 Integration (Optional but Powerful):** Lean4 can play a role in two ways.

* *Formal Knowledge Source:* Lean's `mathlib` contains thousands of formally verified definitions and theorems. To ensure the correctness of our wiki's statements, we could import or mirror content from Lean. For example, when adding a theorem or axiom to the wiki, we could write the Lean code for each. This is a lot of work but guarantees a high degree of rigor. Lean can also output data. Using tools like Lean's API or doc-gen, we can extract the dependency graph of formal statements (Lean knows which lemmas were used in a proof, etc.). Incorporating that data into our graph would make it very accurate (every "uses" edge would be guaranteed by a formal proof). The downside is that not everything is formalized, and formalization takes time. A compromise could be to gradually formalize important parts or use Lean to verify the internal consistency of our axioms.
* *Query and Proof Assistance:* Integration with Lean could even allow us to have Lean or an AI agent connected to Lean find proof paths. For example, an LLM could explore the graph to find relevant lemmas and then try to generate a Lean proof script. In fact, very recent research has built a *"knowledge graph with over 60,000 nodes and 300,000 edges"* from the ProofWiki site and integrated it with Lean and LLMs to automate proof generation. This shows that combining a knowledge graph with a proof assistant is a state-of-the-art approach. In our context, we might not go that far initially, but keeping Lean in mind means structuring our data in a way that could later be fed to a formal proof checker.

**4. Ensuring Data Consistency:** The extraction scripts should be run whenever the content changes (see automation with CI/CD later). They can also perform consistency checks. For example, they could flag if a link in a theorem points to something not categorized as an axiom/definition/theorem (a possible broken link or missing node). They could also detect cycles or other anomalies in the dependency graph, which might indicate a logical problem in how the content is organized.

At the end of this backend process, we will have a dataset of the **populated knowledge graph**. This might be an RDF file (Turtle or JSON-LD) with all the nodes and triples, or a loaded database. At this stage, we essentially have the machine-readable "brain" of our math wiki.

## Publishing and Querying the Graph as Linked Data

To make the knowledge graph useful, we must **publish it as Linked Data** and provide ways to query it interactively.

* **Publishing Linked Data:** Linked Data means that each entity in our graph should have a resolvable **URI**. One simple way is to use the URL of the Quarto page as the identifier. For example, if our site is `mathwiki.org`, the definition of a group might live at `https://mathwiki.org/definitions/group`, and that would serve as the URI for that concept. We can publish the RDF serialization of the entire graph (e.g., a `.ttl` file) on the site (e.g., at a URL like `/graph/mathwiki.ttl`). Ideally, we would set up content negotiation so that if someone fetches a page's URI requesting RDF (via HTTP headers), they get the machine-readable data about that node. This can be done by embedding RDF data in the HTML (using `<script type="application/ld+json">` JSON-LD blocks) or by setting up a small API. A quick solution is to provide a download link for the dataset in an RDF format and, if possible, a SPARQL endpoint for querying.
* **Triple Store / SPARQL Endpoint:** To enable live queries, we can deploy a **triple store** like Apache Jena Fuseki, GraphDB, or an RDF4J server. We feed our RDF triples into these, and they host a SPARQL query endpoint at a URL. For example, a query to "find all theorems that depend on Definition X" could be answered by matching the pattern `?theorem math:uses math:DefinitionX`. By exposing a SPARQL endpoint, we allow users (or other services) to run custom queries against our data. This addresses the goal of interactive querying. We could build a small web form or use an existing SPARQL UI to let users type in questions. Furthermore, the results of SPARQL (which can be in JSON or CSV) can be fetched by scripts to generate dynamic content (e.g., a Quarto page that queries the KG to list all examples of a certain concept).
* **Graph Query API:** If we feel SPARQL is too arcane for end-users, we could implement a simpler query API. For example, a Python backend (Flask/FastAPI) or a Node/TypeScript backend could expose REST endpoints for common queries (e.g., an endpoint `/uses?theorem=TheoremName` that returns all nodes that theorem uses). Internally, that would be translated to a SPARQL query or a lookup in Neo4j. Another modern approach is to use **GraphQL** to provide a more developer-friendly query interface. We could auto-generate a GraphQL schema from our ontology (the classes and relationships).
* **Interactive Query Interface:** We can consider building a UI for interactive exploration. This could be as simple as using an existing graph browser (many triple stores have a web interface) or as custom as building a search bar where someone can type a concept and see a graph of related items. If we are open to TypeScript, we could create a web app (perhaps embedded in the Quarto site via an iframe, or as a static SPA) that allows for interactive navigation. For example, clicking on a theorem node could expand to show the definitions it uses and the theorems that depend on it. Libraries like **D3.js**, **Vis.js**, or **Cytoscape.js** are useful for rendering interactive graph visuals on a web page.

Publishing as true Linked Open Data also means encouraging reuse. Others will be able to dereference your URIs and get data. Aligning with common vocabularies (like Dublin Core for basic metadata) and sharing links to external math databases where applicable would improve interoperability. But the main focus is that *you* can query the graph for your own needs. For example, if you want to check if a particular axiom is ever used in any theorem in topology, you could run a query in seconds rather than hunting through notes.

## Visualizing and Embedding the Graph in Quarto

To make our wiki more insightful, we want to **visualize and embed parts of the knowledge graph into our Quarto pages**. This helps readers understand the context of a particular item (what it depends on, and what depends on it).

There are several ways to do this.

* **Static Diagrams (Mermaid or Graphviz):** For a quick visualization, we can use text-based graph descriptions. Quarto supports embedding **Mermaid** diagrams inside a Markdown fence. For example, we could generate a Mermaid *flowchart* or *graph* description of a node's neighborhood. A Mermaid code block like this:

    ```{mermaid}
    graph LR;
      A[Definition X] --> B(Theorem Y);
      A --> C(Theorem Z);
      C --> D[Example Q];
    ```

    will render a small directed graph. We could have a Python script auto-generate these snippets and include them in the Quarto pages (perhaps via a Quarto filter or by inserting them during rendering). Mermaid is quite flexible, and Quarto can render it correctly (older Quarto versions had issues with HTML escaping, but this is resolved in v1.4+).
* **Dynamic Graph Visualization:** For a richer experience, an interactive graph is ideal. While using **D3.js** or similar directly in Quarto can be tricky, we can embed custom HTML/JS. One approach is to create a small HTML + JavaScript widget that fetches data (perhaps in JSON format) and renders a graph (with force-directed layout, zoom/pan, etc.). We could embed this in a Quarto page using an `<iframe>` or a raw HTML chunk. Another approach is to generate interactive plots using Python. Libraries like **Plotly** or **Bokeh** might be able to handle network graphs. For example, **pyvis** (a Python interface to vis.js) can generate an interactive network graph and save it as an HTML snippet. In a Quarto document (that supports embedded Jupyter output), we could have a code cell that uses pyvis to display the graph for the current topic. The result would be an interactive frame in the page where you can click and hover over nodes.
* **Context-Aware Graph Embedding:** We probably don't want to show the entire graph at once (which would be huge for "all of mathematics"), but rather the *local neighborhood* of the graph. For example, on a definition page, we would show a graph of that definition, the theorems/lemmas that use it, and perhaps related definitions and examples. On a theorem page, we would show which definitions/axioms it uses and which theorems build on it. These subgraphs can be retrieved via a query to the KG. For example, when rendering the page for "Theorem Y," we could run a query to get all nodes one hop away (predecessors and successors in the dependency graph). If we use live queries (via SPARQL or an API), this could be fetched client-side as JSON. Alternatively, we could pre-calculate and store these for each node (e.g., in the page's YAML or a data file) so that the embedding doesn't require a live call.
* **Using TypeScript for Visualization:** If we are comfortable with TypeScript, we could develop the visualization component in TS, perhaps as a standalone web page or a small app embedded in each page. TypeScript could fetch the data from our Linked Data endpoint (e.g., using a SPARQL query over HTTP) and render it using D3 or Three.js. Quarto can include external scripts, so this can be integrated nicely. Another idea is to create a **Neo4j Browser-like experience** on the site, but customized. Neo4j's frontend is built in JS, and we could replicate some of that feel for users exploring our math knowledge.
* **Example of a Visualized Graph:** The Lean4 mathlib knowledge graph project visualized parts of their graph (likely with Neo4j's tools or Gephi). That was offline, but in our wiki, we would aim for on-page visualizations. We can start simple with static images or Mermaid as a proof-of-concept and gradually enhance to interactive visuals once the data is flowing.

By embedding visualizations, we enrich the Quarto wiki for our readers. They can not only read a theorem but also *see* how it fits into the bigger picture (which axioms it assumes, which later results refer to it, etc.). This is highly educational and also helps authors spot if something is isolated or overly dependent on many things.

## Automation with LLMs and CI/CD Pipelines

To manage a project of this scale (covering *all of mathematics* is a long-term mission!), we need to automate as much as possible. Both **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **CI/CD pipelines** will be essential.

* **LLM Assistance:** Large Language Models can assist at multiple stages.
  * *Content Generation:* We can use an LLM to draft pages for definitions or theorems. For example, given a topic or a formal statement, an LLM could generate an initial explanation or proof sketch, which you then verify and edit. This could speed up populating the wiki. However, caution is needed: LLMs can hallucinate or make subtle mathematical errors, so human review or formal verification (with Lean) is critical for anything important.
  * *Relationship Extraction:* An LLM can read a natural language proof and identify which preceding results are being used. If our text linking is incomplete, an LLM could help suggest links ("This proof seems to invoke the concept of compactness. Please link to its definition."). This might be possible with prompt-based analysis or fine-tuning. There is ongoing research in exactly this direction – parsing informal math text to build knowledge graphs. For example, one framework used an LLM to parse ProofWiki entries to build a graph, which was then used for proof generation. Similarly, we could leverage an LLM to keep the graph up-to-date. After writing a new theorem, we could have an LLM (via an API) list all the definitions and theorems it references and compare that to our explicit links to catch missing edges.
  * *Answering User Queries (QA):* In addition to direct graph queries, we could deploy an LLM as a chatbot that uses the knowledge graph as context. The LLM would take a user's question, translate it into a graph query (or search), and formulate an answer with citations to the wiki. This would be like a math Q&A assistant that always checks the wiki graph for relevant information (similar to how some systems use Wikipedia + LLM to answer questions).
  * *Proof Hinting and Automation:* Given the dependency graph, an LLM might suggest lemmas that could be useful for proving a new conjecture. If we formalize the conjecture in Lean, the LLM could use the graph's connections as hints to guide Lean's proof search.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Setting up Continuous Integration and Deployment will keep the system running smoothly.
  * We use a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub/GitLab) for all our Quarto content and perhaps the data scripts. Whenever you or a collaborator pushes a change (a new node or an edit), a CI pipeline is triggered.
  * **Build and Test:** The pipeline runs Quarto to render the site (ensuring no errors in the markdown) and then runs our Python scripts to update the knowledge graph data. We can include tests here. For example, we can ensure that all `@links` in Quarto actually resolve to existing targets and that there are no duplicate IDs. If a test fails, the CI reports it, so we can fix the issue before deployment.
  * **Validation with Lean (if used):** If we maintain a parallel Lean project for formal statements, the CI can also run `leanpkg`/`lake build` to type-check all Lean files. If a proof breaks (e.g., we changed a theorem's statement in the wiki but didn't update the Lean proof), the CI will catch it.
  * **Deploy:** On success, the pipeline can deploy the updated Quarto site (e.g., publish to GitHub Pages or other static hosting). It can also deploy the updated knowledge graph data. For example, it could publish the Turtle file of triples or update the database of a running triple store. Some triple stores allow REST updates; otherwise, we might redeploy a Docker container with the new data. Another approach is to use **Wikidata/Wikibase**. If we chose that, we could also push the data to our Wikibase instance (the MaRDI project has its own Wikibase with millions of items, but they chose not to build from scratch to leverage existing software – in our case, we are proceeding with a custom approach).
  * **Continuous Improvement with LLMs in CI:** We can integrate LLMs into the CI pipeline in a controlled way. For example, on a nightly basis, we could have a job that finds stub articles or missing examples and has an LLM generate candidate text, which is then posted for human review. Or, we could use an LLM to scan for inconsistencies (e.g., by asking questions like, "Does Theorem X, as stated, logically depend on concept Y, which is not linked?").
  * **Versioning and Evolution:** Over time, the knowledge graph will evolve. Using git means all changes are tracked. We might consider tagging releases of the dataset (especially if others use our Linked Data, they might want to cite a version). The CI could generate a summary of changes (e.g., "This update added 5 theorems, updated 2 definitions, and fixed 1 broken link") and publish it to keep users informed.
* **Scalability and Maintenance:** By automating with CI/CD, as the number of nodes grows, the system can regenerate the site and graph without manual intervention. If performance becomes an issue (e.g., a script to rebuild the whole graph is slow with tens of thousands of nodes), we can optimize by doing differential updates (e.g., only reprocessing files that changed and updating their edges). A robust approach would be to store the graph in a database and update only the affected parts rather than rebuilding from scratch every time. The CI could handle both full rebuilds (perhaps for major changes) and quick, differential updates for small edits.

In summary, **automation is key** to managing this knowledge base. LLMs can act as intelligent assistants to reduce manual effort (though supervision is needed), and CI/CD is the glue that integrates all the components—Quarto content, knowledge graph extraction, data serving, and site deployment—into one seamless workflow.

## Overall Summary

Designing a mathematical knowledge graph wiki from scratch is a large undertaking, but it becomes manageable with a systematic approach. Here is the plan in outline:

1. **Design the Schema:** Define what node and relationship types we will have (Axiom, Definition, Theorem, Example, etc., with relationships like "uses," "implies," "hasExample"). Consider adopting an existing ontology for Linked Data compatibility.
2. **Create Content in Quarto:** Write the mathematical content in `.qmd` files, one node per file. Use a clear structure and hyperlink references to other nodes mentioned. Add metadata (YAML) as needed for identification and custom fields (like type or prerequisites). Leverage Quarto's features for consistent formatting of theorems, proofs, etc.
3. **Parse and Build the Graph:** Use a Python script to parse the Quarto files or their rendered HTML to extract the nodes and their connections. Build the knowledge graph in RDF triples (using rdflib) or a graph database. Ensure each node gets a unique URI and is annotated with its type and textual description. Store the graph data (e.g., as a Turtle file or in a database).
4. **Publish as Linked Data:** Host the RDF data of the graph on the web (this could be a simple file or a SPARQL endpoint in a triple store). Ensure anyone (or any program) can look up a term's URI and get its information, fulfilling the principles of Linked Data. Set up a SPARQL endpoint for advanced queries and/or provide a REST/GraphQL API for convenience.
5. **Embed Query Results and Visualizations:** Enhance the Quarto pages by pulling data from the graph. This might mean automatically listing "Prerequisites: Definition X, Theorem Y" at the top of a theorem page by querying the graph. Also, embed graphs (Mermaid for static diagrams, interactive JS for dynamic ones) to visualize the local part of the knowledge graph around each node. This helps users navigate and understand the context.
6. **Automate with CI/CD:** Use a continuous integration pipeline to tie everything together. Whenever content is added or changed, the pipeline builds the site and extracts the graph. It should also run any validation (tests, possibly Lean proofs) to maintain integrity. On success, it deploys the updated site and updates the Linked Data backend. This process should be reproducible and mostly automatic.
7. **LLMs and Future Integration:** Gradually integrate LLMs to assist with content and maintenance – for example, generating draft content, checking for missing links, or even interacting with users in natural language using the knowledge graph as a source. Continue to integrate with formal tools like Lean4 to ensure the highest reliability for critical parts (Lean can guarantee no false theorems are introduced by requiring a proof in its formal system).

By following this plan, we can develop a rich, **self-updating mathematical knowledge wiki** that allows for interactive exploration of mathematics. We can query for all uses of a concept, all examples of a property, the dependency tree of a theorem, etc. (via SPARQL or a custom interface). Mathematicians and students will benefit from seeing the big picture of results, and automated tools (LLMs, theorem provers) can leverage the structured data to push the frontiers of automated reasoning. The system will evolve over time – perhaps starting with a narrower domain and gradually expanding – but the framework of Quarto + Python + Linked Data + Automation will support its growth. With careful curation and smart automation, you will be on track to curate a *"searchable database of mathematical results"* and an interactive knowledge graph that truly covers all of mathematics.

**References:** The approach detailed above is based on existing research and tools in mathematical knowledge management. Key inspirations include the use of if/then logic for structuring mathematical knowledge into graphs, the practice of Quarto-based wikis, projects like the Lean mathlib graph extraction, the OntoMathPRO ontology for representing mathematical knowledge, the MaRDI knowledge graph initiative, and recent efforts to combine knowledge graphs with LLMs and formal provers to automate mathematics. These resources demonstrate the feasibility and best practices for building a comprehensive, connected repository of mathematical knowledge.
