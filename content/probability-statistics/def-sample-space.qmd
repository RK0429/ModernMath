A **sample space** is the @def-set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment or probabilistic scenario. It is typically denoted by $\Omega$ (omega) or $S$.

## Formal Definition

A sample space $\Omega$ is a non-empty set such that:
1. It contains all possible outcomes of the experiment
2. The outcomes are mutually exclusive (only one can occur)
3. The outcomes are collectively exhaustive (one must occur)

## Types of Sample Spaces

### Discrete Sample Spaces
- **Finite**: Contains a finite number of outcomes
  - Example: Rolling a die: $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- **Countably Infinite**: Contains countably many outcomes
  - Example: Number of coin flips until first heads: $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$

### Continuous Sample Spaces
- Contains uncountably many outcomes
- Example: Measuring reaction time: $\Omega = [0, \infty)$

## Examples

1. **Coin Flip**: $\Omega = \{H, T\}$ (heads, tails)
2. **Two Dice**: $\Omega = \{(i,j) : i,j \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\}$ (36 outcomes)
3. **Random Point in Unit Square**: $\Omega = [0,1] \times [0,1]$
4. **Lifetime of a Lightbulb**: $\Omega = [0, \infty)$

## Relationship to Probability

- Every element $\omega \in \Omega$ is called an **elementary outcome**
- Subsets of $\Omega$ are called **events** (see @def-event)
- A @def-probability-space is built upon a sample space
- The entire sample space $\Omega$ has probability 1: $P(\Omega) = 1$

## Properties

- The empty set $\emptyset$ represents an impossible event
- The sample space $\Omega$ represents the certain event
- Sample spaces must be defined carefully to capture all relevant outcomes
- The choice of sample space affects how probabilities are calculated
