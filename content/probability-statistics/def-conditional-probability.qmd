The **conditional probability** of an @def-event $A$ given event $B$ is the probability that $A$ occurs, given that $B$ has occurred. It is denoted $P(A|B)$.

## Formal Definition

Given two events $A$ and $B$ in a @def-probability-space, with $P(B) > 0$, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

## Intuition

- $P(A|B)$ represents the "updated" probability of $A$ after learning that $B$ occurred
- We restrict our attention to the subset of outcomes where $B$ occurs
- We rescale probabilities so that $P(B|B) = 1$

## Properties

1. **Range**: $0 \leq P(A|B) \leq 1$
2. **Certainty**: $P(B|B) = 1$ when $P(B) > 0$
3. **Impossibility**: $P(\emptyset|B) = 0$
4. **Subset**: If $A \subseteq B$, then $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}$

## Multiplication Rule

Rearranging the definition gives:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)$$

For multiple events:
$$P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n) = P(A_1)P(A_2|A_1)P(A_3|A_1 \cap A_2)\cdots P(A_n|A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_{n-1})$$

## Independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if and only if:
$$P(A|B) = P(A)$$

This means knowing $B$ occurred doesn't change the probability of $A$.

## Examples

1. **Card Drawing**: Drawing an ace from a standard deck
   - $P(\text{Ace}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$
   - $P(\text{Ace}|\text{Red card}) = \frac{2}{26} = \frac{1}{13}$ (independent)
   - $P(\text{Ace}|\text{Face card}) = 0$ (mutually exclusive)

2. **Medical Testing**: Disease prevalence and test accuracy
   - If $P(\text{Disease}) = 0.01$ and test is 95% accurate
   - $P(\text{Positive}|\text{Disease})$ represents sensitivity
