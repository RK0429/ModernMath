# Principal Ideals in Integers

Every [Ideal](def-ideal.qmd) in the [Ring](def-ring.qmd) of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is principal, generated by a single element.

## Principal Ideal Generated by n

For any integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, the principal ideal generated by $n$ is:
$$(n) = n\mathbb{Z} = \{na : a \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

### Concrete Examples

1. **Ideal generated by 2**: $(2) = 2\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, ...\}$
   - These are all even integers

2. **Ideal generated by 5**: $(5) = 5\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, ...\}$
   - These are all multiples of 5

3. **Ideal generated by 0**: $(0) = \{0\}$
   - The zero ideal contains only zero

4. **Ideal generated by 1**: $(1) = \mathbb{Z}$
   - Since $1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$

## Verification of Ideal Properties

Let's verify that $(n)$ is indeed an ideal:

### Additive Subgroup
- **Contains zero**: $0 = n \cdot 0 \in (n)$
- **Closed under addition**: If $na, nb \in (n)$, then $na + nb = n(a + b) \in (n)$
- **Contains additive inverses**: If $na \in (n)$, then $-na = n(-a) \in (n)$

### Absorption Property
For any $r \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $na \in (n)$:
- $r \cdot (na) = (rn)a = n(ra) \in (n)$

Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is commutative, we don't need to check right absorption separately.

## Connection to GCD

For two ideals $(a)$ and $(b)$ in $\mathbb{Z}$:
- Their sum is $(a) + (b) = (\gcd(a,b))$
- Their intersection is $(a) \cap (b) = (\text{lcm}(a,b))$ (see @../number-theory/def-lcm)

where $\gcd$ denotes the [Greatest Common Divisor](../number-theory/def-gcd.qmd).
