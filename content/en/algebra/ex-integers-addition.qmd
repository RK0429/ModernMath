# Integers under Addition {#ex-integers-addition}

The integers $\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$ form a [Group](def-group.qmd) under the [Binary Operation](def-binary-operation.qmd) of addition.

## Verification of Group Axioms

We denote this group as $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ and verify each group axiom:

### 1. Closure

For any $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, the sum $a + b$ is also an integer. This follows from the definition of integer addition.

### 2. Associativity

For all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$:
$$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$

This is a fundamental property of integer addition.

### 3. Identity Element

The integer $0$ serves as the identity element:
- For any $a \in \mathbb{Z}$: $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$

By [Uniqueness of Identity](thm-unique-identity.qmd), this identity element is unique.

### 4. Inverse Elements

For each $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, the integer $-a$ is its inverse:
- $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$

## Additional Properties

The group $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ has several important additional properties:

1. **Commutativity**: $a + b = b + a$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$
   - This makes $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ an **[abelian group](def-abelian-group.qmd)**

2. **Infinite order**: The group has infinitely many elements

3. **[Cyclic](def-cyclic-group.qmd)**: The group is generated by the single element $1$:
   - Every integer can be written as $n \cdot 1$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$

## Subgroups

Notable subgroups of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ include:
- $n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk : k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- For example, $2\mathbb{Z}$ is the subgroup of even integers

## Related Examples

- The rationals $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$ form a group containing $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ as a subgroup
- The integers modulo $n$, denoted $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, form finite groups (see [Example: Integers Modulo n](ex-quotient-integers-mod-n.qmd) for the quotient group construction)
