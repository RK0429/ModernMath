# Simple Group {#def-simple-group}

A **simple group** is a non-trivial [group](def-group.qmd) whose only [normal subgroups](def-normal-subgroup.qmd) are the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$ and the group itself $G$.

## Formal Definition

A group $G$ is simple if:
1. $G \neq \{e\}$ (the group is non-trivial)
2. The only normal subgroups of $G$ are $\{e\}$ and $G$

## Equivalent Characterizations

A group $G$ is simple if and only if:
- $G$ has no proper non-trivial normal subgroups
- For any normal subgroup $N \triangleleft G$, either $N = \{e\}$ or $N = G$
- The only [quotient groups](def-quotient-group.qmd) of $G$ are $G/\{e\} \cong G$ and $G/G \cong \{e\}$

## Importance

Simple groups are fundamental in group theory because:
- They serve as the "building blocks" of all finite groups
- The Jordan-HÃ¶lder theorem shows that every finite group can be broken down into a composition series of simple groups
- They cannot be decomposed into smaller groups via the quotient construction

## Classification

### Abelian Simple Groups
The only [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd) simple groups are the [cyclic groups](def-cyclic-group.qmd) of prime [order](def-order.qmd):
- $\mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is prime

This follows from [Lagrange's theorem](thm-lagrange.qmd): a group of prime [order](def-order.qmd) has no proper non-trivial subgroups.

### Non-Abelian Simple Groups
The complete classification of finite simple groups includes:

1. **Cyclic groups of prime [order](def-order.qmd)**: $\mathbb{Z}_p$
2. **Alternating groups**: $A_n$ for $n \geq 5$
3. **Groups of Lie type**: Classical groups over finite fields
4. **Sporadic groups**: 26 exceptional groups

## Examples

### Simple Groups
- $\mathbb{Z}_2, \mathbb{Z}_3, \mathbb{Z}_5, \ldots$ (cyclic groups of prime [order](def-order.qmd))
- $A_5$ (the alternating group on 5 elements, smallest non-abelian simple group with 60 elements)
- $A_n$ for all $n \geq 5$
- $PSL(2, 7)$ (projective special linear group with 168 elements)

### Non-Simple Groups
- $\mathbb{Z}_4$ has $\{0, 2\}$ as a proper normal subgroup
- $S_n$ for $n \geq 2$ has $A_n$ as a proper normal subgroup
- Any abelian group of composite [order](def-order.qmd)

## Properties

1. **Simplicity and Homomorphisms**: If $\phi: G \to H$ is a [homomorphism](def-homomorphism.qmd) from a simple group $G$, then either:
   - $\phi$ is trivial (maps everything to identity), or
   - $\phi$ is injective (by the [first isomorphism theorem](thm-first-isomorphism.qmd))

2. **Center**: The [center](def-center-of-group.qmd) of a non-abelian simple group is trivial

3. **Minimal Normal Subgroups**: A simple group is a minimal normal subgroup of any group containing it
