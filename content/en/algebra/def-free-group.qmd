# Free Group {#def-free-group}

A **free group** on a [@set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) $S$ is a [@group](def-group.qmd) $F(S)$ together with a [@function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) $i: S \to F(S)$ that satisfies the following universal property:

## Formal Definition

For any [@group](def-group.qmd) $G$ and any function $f: S \to G$, there exists a unique [@group homomorphism](def-homomorphism.qmd) $\phi: F(S) \to G$ such that $\phi \circ i = f$.

That is, the following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
S & \xrightarrow{i} & F(S) \\
& \searrow^{f} & \downarrow^{\exists! \phi} \\
& & G
\end{array}
$$

## Alternative Construction

The free group $F(S)$ can be constructed explicitly as follows:

1. **Alphabet**: Consider the set $S \cup S^{-1}$, where $S^{-1} = \{s^{-1} : s \in S\}$ is a disjoint copy of $S$ (formal inverses).

2. **Words**: A word is a finite sequence $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ where each $x_i \in S \cup S^{-1}$.

3. **Reduced words**: A word is reduced if it contains no adjacent pairs of the form $ss^{-1}$ or $s^{-1}s$ for any $s \in S$.

4. **Group operation**: The product of two reduced words is obtained by concatenation followed by reduction (removing adjacent inverse pairs).

5. The [@identity element](def-identity-element.qmd) is the empty word, and the [@inverse](def-inverse-element.qmd) of a word $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is $(x_n^{-1}, \ldots, x_2^{-1}, x_1^{-1})$.

## Notation

- Standard notation: $F(S)$ or $F_S$ for the free group on set $S$
- For a finite set with $n$ elements: $F_n$ denotes the free group on $n$ generators
- Elements of $S$ embedded in $F(S)$ are called **free generators**
- The set $S$ is called a **basis** of $F(S)$

## Intuitive Understanding

A free group is the "most general" group generated by a set $S$. It contains all possible products of elements from $S$ and their inverses, with no relations beyond those required by the group axioms. Think of it as:

- **Algebraically**: The group of all "words" you can form from an alphabet $S$ and formal inverses $S^{-1}$, where concatenation is the operation and you can cancel adjacent inverse pairs.

- **Categorically**: The free group functor is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from groups to sets, making it the "optimal" way to turn a set into a group.

- **No constraints**: Unlike other groups where generators might satisfy relations (like $a^2 = e$ or $ab = ba$), in a free group the only relations are those forced by the group axioms.

## Key Properties

- **Uniqueness**: The free group $F(S)$ is unique up to isomorphism
- **Non-abelian**: For $|S| \geq 2$, the free group $F(S)$ is non-abelian
- **Rank**: The cardinality $|S|$ is called the rank of the free group
- **Subgroups**: Every subgroup of a free group is free (Nielsen-Schreier theorem)
- **Presentation**: Every group is isomorphic to a quotient of some free group

## Examples

Common examples include:
- $F_1 = F(\{a\}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$: The free group on one generator is isomorphic to the integers
- $F_2 = F(\{a, b\})$: The free group on two generators, a non-abelian group
- The fundamental group of a figure-eight is isomorphic to $F_2$

## Special Types

- **Free abelian group**: The abelianization of a free group, obtained by adding commutativity relations
- **Free product**: A generalization where multiple groups are combined freely

See:
- @def-abelian-group for the abelian case
- @def-quotient-group for how groups arise as quotients of free groups

## Related Concepts

- **Generalizations**: Free objects exist in many categories (free modules, free algebras)
- **Applications**: Used in topology (fundamental groups), combinatorics (word problems), and geometric group theory
- **Presentations**: Groups defined by generators and relations start with free groups
