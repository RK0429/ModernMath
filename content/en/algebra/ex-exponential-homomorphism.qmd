# Exponential Homomorphism {#ex-exponential-homomorphism}

The exponential function provides a classic example of a [Group Homomorphism](def-homomorphism.qmd) between [Group](def-group.qmd) structures.

## The Homomorphism

Consider the function:
$$\exp: (\mathbb{R}, +) \to (\mathbb{R}^+, \cdot)$$
$$\exp(x) = e^x$$

where $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ is the additive group of real numbers and $(\mathbb{R}^+, \cdot)$ is the multiplicative group of positive real numbers.

## Verification

To verify this is a homomorphism, we check:
$$\exp(x + y) = e^{x+y} = e^x \cdot e^y = \exp(x) \cdot \exp(y)$$

## Properties

- **Injective**: Yes, since $e^x = e^y$ implies $x = y$
- **Surjective**: Yes, for any $a \in \mathbb{R}^+$, we have $\exp(\ln a) = a$
- **Bijective**: Therefore, $\exp$ is an [isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd)

## Inverse

The natural logarithm $\ln: (\mathbb{R}^+, \cdot) \to (\mathbb{R}, +)$ is the inverse [isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd):
$$\ln(xy) = \ln(x) + \ln(y)$$
