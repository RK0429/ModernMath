# Quotient Group {#def-quotient-group}

A **quotient group** (also called a **factor group**) is a [group](def-group.qmd) formed by partitioning a group into [cosets](def-coset.qmd) of a [normal subgroup](def-normal-subgroup.qmd). The cosets form the equivalence classes of an [equivalence relation](../logic-set-theory/def-equivalence-relation.qmd).

## Formal Definition

Let $G$ be a group and $N \triangleleft G$ be a normal subgroup. The **quotient group** of $G$ by $N$, denoted $G/N$ (read "$G$ modulo $N$"), is the set of all left cosets of $N$ in $G$:

$$G/N = \{gN : g \in G\}$$

where $gN = \{gn : n \in N\}$ is the left coset of $N$ containing $g$.

## Group Structure

The quotient $G/N$ becomes a group under the operation:

$$(gN) \cdot (hN) = (gh)N$$

This operation is well-defined precisely because $N$ is normal in $G$.

### Verification of Group Axioms

1. **Closure**: For any $gN, hN \in G/N$, we have $(gN)(hN) = (gh)N \in G/N$

2. **Associativity**: Inherited from the associativity in $G$:
   $$((gN)(hN))(kN) = (gh)N \cdot kN = ((gh)k)N = (g(hk))N = gN \cdot (hk)N = (gN)((hN)(kN))$$

3. **Identity**: The coset $eN = N$ serves as the identity element:
   $$(gN) \cdot N = (gN) \cdot (eN) = (ge)N = gN$$

4. **Inverses**: For each $gN \in G/N$, the inverse is $(g^{-1})N$:
   $$(gN) \cdot (g^{-1}N) = (gg^{-1})N = eN = N$$

## Fundamental Properties

### Order of Quotient Group

If $G$ is finite, then the [cardinality](../logic-set-theory/def-cardinality.qmd) satisfies:
$$|G/N| = \frac{|G|}{|N|} = [G:N]$$

This is the index of $N$ in $G$.

### The Natural Homomorphism

The map $\pi: G \to G/N$ defined by $\pi(g) = gN$ is a surjective group [homomorphism](def-homomorphism.qmd) (i.e., an [epimorphism](../category-theory/def-epimorphism.qmd)) called the **natural homomorphism** or **canonical projection**. Its kernel is exactly $N$:
$$\ker(\pi) = N$$

### Inheritance of Properties

1. If $G$ is [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd), then $G/N$ is [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd)
2. If $G$ is [cyclic](def-cyclic-group.qmd), then $G/N$ is [cyclic](def-cyclic-group.qmd)
3. If $G$ is finitely generated, then $G/N$ is finitely generated

## Examples

### 1. Integers Modulo n

The quotient group $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ consists of the residue classes modulo $n$:
$$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{0 + n\mathbb{Z}, 1 + n\mathbb{Z}, ..., (n-1) + n\mathbb{Z}\}$$

This is the [cyclic group](def-cyclic-group.qmd) of [order](def-order.qmd) $n$, often denoted $\mathbb{Z}_n$ or $C_n$.

### 2. The Circle Group

The quotient $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ can be identified with the circle group $S^1$:
- Elements are cosets $x + \mathbb{Z}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$
- Two reals $x, y$ are in the same coset iff $x - y \in \mathbb{Z}$

### 3. Quotient by the Center

For any group $G$, the quotient $G/Z(G)$ by its [center](def-center-of-group.qmd) measures how "non-abelian" the group is:
- If $G/Z(G)$ is [cyclic](def-cyclic-group.qmd), then $G$ is [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd)
- If $|G/Z(G)| = 1$, then $G = Z(G)$, so $G$ is [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd)

### 4. Simple Groups

A group $G$ is [**simple**](def-simple-group.qmd) if its only normal subgroups are $\{e\}$ and $G$ itself. For simple groups, the only quotient groups are:
- $G/\{e\} \cong G$
- $G/G \cong \{e\}$

The [Sylow theorems](thm-sylow.qmd) are often used to prove that groups of certain orders cannot be simple.

## Geometric Interpretation

Quotient groups can be visualized as:
- **Collapsing** the normal subgroup $N$ to a single point (the identity)
- **Identifying** elements that differ by an element of $N$
- Creating a "simpler" group by "modding out" the structure of $N$

## Applications

### First Isomorphism Theorem

The [First Isomorphism Theorem](thm-first-isomorphism.qmd) states that if $\phi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism, then:
$$G/\ker(\phi) \cong \text{Im}(\phi)$$

This fundamental result shows that every homomorphic image is (up to isomorphism) a quotient group. See @thm-first-isomorphism for the complete statement and proof.

### Classification of Groups

Quotient groups are essential for:
- Understanding the structure of finite groups
- The Jordan-HÃ¶lder theorem (composition series)
- Solvable and nilpotent groups

### Exact Sequences

In the short [exact sequence](def-exact-sequence.qmd):
$$1 \to N \to G \to G/N \to 1$$

The quotient group $G/N$ captures the "complement" of $N$ in $G$.

## Parallel Concepts in Other Algebraic Structures

The concept of quotient groups generalizes to other algebraic structures:

- **[Quotient Rings](def-quotient-ring.qmd)**: Just as normal subgroups allow us to form quotient groups, [Ideals](def-ideal.qmd) allow us to form quotient rings. For example, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ can be viewed both as a quotient group (of the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$) and as a quotient ring.
- **Quotient Vector Spaces**: Vector spaces can be quotiented by subspaces
- **Quotient [Modules](def-module.qmd)**: The most general case, encompassing both groups and vector spaces

This pattern of "modding out" by a suitable substructure is fundamental throughout algebra.
