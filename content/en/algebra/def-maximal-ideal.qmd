# Maximal Ideal {#def-maximal-ideal}

A **maximal ideal** is an [ideal](def-ideal.qmd) that is maximal with respect to set inclusion among all proper ideals. In other words, it is a proper ideal that is not properly contained in any other proper ideal.

## Formal Definition

Let $R$ be a [ring](def-ring.qmd). An [ideal](def-ideal.qmd) $M \subseteq R$ is called a **maximal ideal** if:

1. $M \neq R$ (proper ideal)
2. For any ideal $I$ of $R$: if $M \subseteq I \subseteq R$, then either $I = M$ or $I = R$

Equivalently, $M$ is maximal if there is no ideal strictly between $M$ and $R$.

## Equivalent Characterizations

### Quotient Ring Characterization

An ideal $M$ in a ring $R$ is maximal if and only if the [quotient ring](def-quotient-ring.qmd) $R/M$ is a [field](def-field.qmd).

**Proof**:
- ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $M$ is maximal. Let $a + M \neq 0 + M$ in $R/M$. Then $a \notin M$, so the ideal $(M, a) = M + (a)$ properly contains $M$. By maximality, $(M, a) = R$, so $1 = m + ra$ for some $m \in M$ and $r \in R$. Thus $(r + M)(a + M) = 1 + M$, showing $a + M$ has an inverse.
- ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $R/M$ is a field. Let $I$ be an ideal with $M \subset I \subseteq R$. Take $a \in I \setminus M$. Since $a + M \neq 0 + M$ and $R/M$ is a field, there exists $r \in R$ with $(r + M)(a + M) = 1 + M$. Thus $1 - ra \in M \subset I$, so $1 = (1 - ra) + ra \in I$, which implies $I = R$.

### Zorn's Lemma Characterization

Every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal. This follows from Zorn's lemma applied to the partially ordered set of proper ideals containing a given ideal.

## Properties

- Every maximal ideal is a [prime ideal](def-prime-ideal.qmd)
- The converse is not true: not every prime ideal is maximal
- In a commutative ring with unity, every nonzero prime ideal contains a minimal prime ideal and is contained in a maximal ideal
- Krull's theorem: Every ring with identity has at least one maximal left ideal (and similarly for right and two-sided ideals)

## Examples

### In the Integers

In $\mathbb{Z}$:
- The ideal $(p) = p\mathbb{Z}$ is maximal if and only if $p$ is a prime number
- This is because $\mathbb{Z}/(p) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field if and only if $p$ is prime
- $(0)$ is prime but not maximal since $(0) \subset (p) \subset \mathbb{Z}$ for any prime $p$

### In Polynomial Rings

In $\mathbb{R}[x]$:
- $(x - a)$ is maximal for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$ since $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x - a) \cong \mathbb{R}$ is a field
- $(x^2 + 1)$ is maximal since $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1) \cong \mathbb{C}$ is a field
- $(x)$ is not maximal in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ since $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is not a field

### In Function Rings

In $C[a,b]$, the ring of continuous real-valued functions on $[a,b]$:
- For any $x_0 \in [a,b]$, the ideal $M_{x_0} = \{f \in C[a,b] : f(x_0) = 0\}$ is maximal
- The quotient $C[a,b]/M_{x_0} \cong \mathbb{R}$ via the evaluation map $f + M_{x_0} \mapsto f(x_0)$

## Connection to Algebraic Geometry

In algebraic geometry:
- Maximal ideals correspond to points in the spectrum of a ring
- For $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ where $k$ is algebraically closed, maximal ideals correspond to points in $k^n$ via Hilbert's Nullstellensatz
- The maximal spectrum $\text{Specm}(R)$ consists of all maximal ideals and forms a subspace of the prime spectrum

## The Jacobson Radical

The intersection of all maximal ideals in a ring $R$ is called the Jacobson radical $J(R)$:
- $J(R) = \bigcap \{M : M \text{ is a maximal ideal of } R\}$
- An element belongs to $J(R)$ if and only if $1 - rx$ is a unit for all $r \in R$
- The quotient $R/J(R)$ is a semisimple ring

## Historical Note

The concept of maximal ideals emerged from Emmy Noether's abstract approach to ideal theory in the 1920s. The existence of maximal ideals in rings with identity (Krull's theorem, 1929) was one of the first significant applications of Zorn's lemma in algebra, demonstrating the power of set-theoretic methods in ring theory.
