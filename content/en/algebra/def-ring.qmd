# Ring {#def-ring}

A **ring** is a [Set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) equipped with two [Binary Operation](def-binary-operation.qmd) operations that generalize the arithmetic of integers.

## Formal Definition

A ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ consists of a set $R$ together with two binary operations, addition $(+)$ and multiplication $(\cdot)$, such that:

### Addition Axioms
1. $(R, +)$ is an [abelian group](def-abelian-group.qmd):
   - **Associativity**: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
   - **Commutativity**: $a + b = b + a$
   - **Identity**: There exists $0 \in R$ such that $a + 0 = a$
   - **Inverses**: For each $a \in R$, there exists $-a \in R$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$

### Multiplication Axioms
2. Multiplication is associative: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$

### Distributive Laws
3. Left distributivity: $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
4. Right distributivity: $(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$

## Types of Rings

- **Commutative ring**: $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b$
- **Ring with unity**: There exists $1 \in R$ such that $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$
- **Integral domain**: Commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors
- **Field**: Commutative ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse

## Examples

- $(\mathbb{Z}, +, \cdot)$ - integers under addition and multiplication
- $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ - $n \times n$ matrices with real entries
- $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ - [polynomial ring](def-polynomial-ring.qmd) with integer coefficients

## Important Ring Structures

- **[Ideals](def-ideal.qmd)**: Special subsets that absorb multiplication, analogous to normal subgroups in group theory
- **Subrings**: Subsets closed under both ring operations
- **Quotient rings**: Formed by factoring out ideals, generalizing modular arithmetic
- **Ring homomorphisms**: Structure-preserving maps between rings
