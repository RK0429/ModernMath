[Group actions](def-group-action.qmd) are fundamental in understanding symmetries. Here are several important examples.

## Trivial Action

For any [group](def-group.qmd) $G$ and set $X$, the **trivial action** is defined by:
$$g \cdot x = x \text{ for all } g \in G, x \in X$$

Every element of $X$ is a fixed point, and each orbit consists of a single element.

## Left Multiplication Action

A group $G$ acts on itself by left multiplication:
$$g \cdot h = gh \text{ for } g, h \in G$$

This action is:
- **Transitive**: For any $h_1, h_2 \in G$, we have $h_2h_1^{-1} \cdot h_1 = h_2$
- **Free**: If $g \cdot h = h$, then $gh = h$, so $g = e$

## Conjugation Action

A group $G$ acts on itself by conjugation:
$$g \cdot h = ghg^{-1} \text{ for } g, h \in G$$

This action defines inner [automorphisms](def-automorphism.qmd) of $G$.

Properties:
- The orbit of $h$ is its conjugacy class: $\{ghg^{-1} : g \in G\}$
- The stabilizer of $h$ is its centralizer: $C_G(h) = \{g \in G : gh = hg\}$
- Fixed points are exactly the elements of the [center](def-center-of-group.qmd) $Z(G)$

## Symmetric Group on a Set

The symmetric group $S_n$ acts naturally on the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ by:
$$\sigma \cdot i = \sigma(i) \text{ for } \sigma \in S_n, i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$

This action is:
- **Transitive**: Any element can be mapped to any other by some permutation
- **Faithful**: Different permutations act differently on the set

## Dihedral Group on a Polygon

The dihedral group $D_n$ acts on the vertices of a regular $n$-gon:
- Rotations move vertices cyclically
- Reflections flip vertices across axes of symmetry

For a square ($n = 4$):
- The stabilizer of any vertex has [order](def-order.qmd) 2 (identity and one reflection)
- Each orbit is the entire set of vertices (transitive action)
- By the orbit-stabilizer theorem: $|D_4| = |orbit| \times |stabilizer| = 4 \times 2 = 8$

## Cyclic Group on Roots of Unity

The [cyclic group](def-cyclic-group.qmd) $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ acts on the $n$-th roots of unity in $\mathbb{C}$:
$$k \cdot \omega = \omega \cdot e^{2\pi i k/n} \text{ where } \omega = e^{2\pi i j/n}$$

This gives a rotation of the complex unit circle by multiples of $2\pi/n$.
