# Group {#def-group-example}

## Definition

A **group** is a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot: G \times G \to G$ that satisfies the following axioms:

1. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, we have $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
2. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$, we have $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$
3. **Inverse elements**: For each $a \in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$

## Notation

- The group operation is often written multiplicatively as $ab$ instead of $a \cdot b$
- When the operation is addition, we write $a + b$ and use $0$ for the identity and $-a$ for the inverse
- We denote a group by $(G, \cdot)$ or simply $G$ when the operation is clear from context

## Properties

- The identity element is unique (@thm-unique-identity)
- For each element, the inverse is unique
- The cancellation laws hold: if $ab = ac$ then $b = c$

## Examples

- The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition form a group (@ex-integers-addition)
- The non-zero real numbers $\mathbb{R}^*$ under multiplication form a group
- The set of $n \times n$ invertible matrices over a field forms a group under matrix multiplication
