# Lagrange's Theorem {#thm-lagrange}

For a finite [Group](def-group.qmd) $G$ and a [Subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) $H$ of $G$, the order of $H$ [divides](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) the order of $G$.

## Statement

If $G$ is a finite group and $H \leq G$, then:
$$|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]$$

where $|G|$ denotes the [order](def-order.qmd) ([cardinality](../logic-set-theory/def-cardinality.qmd)) of $G$, and $[G:H]$ is the index of $H$ in $G$ (the number of distinct left [cosets](def-coset.qmd) of $H$ in $G$).

### Connection to Quotient Groups

When $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, the index $[G:H]$ equals the order of the @def-quotient-group $G/H$:
$$[G:H] = |G/H|$$

This provides another interpretation of Lagrange's theorem: the order of a quotient group [divides](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) the order of the original group.

## Corollaries

1. The [order](def-order.qmd) of any element $a \in G$ [divides](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) the [order](def-order.qmd) of $G$
2. If $|G|$ is prime, then $G$ is [cyclic](def-cyclic-group.qmd) and has no proper non-trivial subgroups
3. Any group of prime order is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$
4. For prime powers, see the [Sylow theorems](thm-sylow.qmd) which provide a partial converse

## Applications

Lagrange's theorem is fundamental in group theory and has numerous applications:
- Determining possible subgroup structures
- Proving [Fermat's Little Theorem](../number-theory/thm-fermat-little.qmd)
- Classifying groups of small order
