# Ring Homomorphism {#def-ring-homomorphism}

A **ring homomorphism** is a [function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) between two [rings](def-ring.qmd) that preserves both ring [binary operations](def-binary-operation.qmd) (addition and multiplication).

## Formal Definition

Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ and $(S, \oplus, \odot)$ be rings. A function $f: R \to S$ is a ring homomorphism if:

1. **Addition preservation**: $f(a + b) = f(a) \oplus f(b)$ for all $a, b \in R$
2. **Multiplication preservation**: $f(a \cdot b) = f(a) \odot f(b)$ for all $a, b \in R$
3. **Unity preservation**: $f(1_R) = 1_S$ (if $R$ and $S$ have multiplicative identities)

## Notation

- Standard notation: $f: R \to S$ or $f: R \rightarrow S$
- For the image of an element: $f(r)$ or sometimes $r^f$
- Kernel notation: $\ker(f) = \{r \in R : f(r) = 0_S\}$

## Intuitive Understanding

A ring homomorphism is a way to "translate" between two rings while preserving their algebraic structure. Just as a translator preserves the meaning of sentences when converting between languages, a ring homomorphism preserves the arithmetic relationships when mapping elements from one ring to another. If $a + b = c$ in the first ring, then $f(a) + f(b) = f(c)$ in the second ring.

## Key Properties

Ring homomorphisms automatically preserve several important elements and structures:

- **Zero preservation**: $f(0_R) = 0_S$ (the additive identity)
- **Additive inverse preservation**: $f(-a) = -f(a)$ for all $a \in R$
- **Powers preservation**: $f(a^n) = f(a)^n$ for all $a \in R$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- **Subring preservation**: If $T$ is a [subring](def-subring.qmd) of $R$, then $f(T)$ is a subring of $S$

## Examples

Common examples include:
- The natural map $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ sending integers to their residue classes modulo $n$
- The evaluation map from a [polynomial ring](def-polynomial-ring.qmd) $R[x]$ to $R$ given by evaluating at a fixed element
- The inclusion map from any subring to its parent ring

## Special Types

- **[Monomorphism](../category-theory/def-monomorphism.qmd)**: An injective ring homomorphism
- **[Epimorphism](../category-theory/def-epimorphism.qmd)**: A surjective ring homomorphism
- **[Isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd)**: A bijective ring homomorphism (note: the inverse is automatically a ring homomorphism)
- **[Endomorphism](def-endomorphism.qmd)**: A ring homomorphism from a ring to itself
- **[Automorphism](def-automorphism.qmd)**: A bijective endomorphism

## Kernel and Image

For a ring homomorphism $f: R \to S$:

- The **kernel** is $\ker(f) = \{r \in R : f(r) = 0_S\}$, which is always a two-sided [ideal](def-ideal.qmd) of $R$
- The **image** is $\text{Im}(f) = \{f(r) : r \in R\}$, which is always a subring of $S$

The kernel completely determines whether the homomorphism is injective: $f$ is injective if and only if $\ker(f) = \{0_R\}$.

## First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings

The fundamental relationship between ring homomorphisms and quotient rings is given by the [First Isomorphism Theorem](thm-first-isomorphism.qmd):

$$R/\ker(f) \cong \text{Im}(f)$$

This shows that every homomorphic image of a ring is isomorphic to a [quotient ring](def-quotient-ring.qmd), establishing a deep connection between ring homomorphisms and ideal theory.

## Related Concepts

- **Generalizations**: Module homomorphisms preserve module structure over a ring
- **Specializations**: [Group homomorphisms](def-homomorphism.qmd) (considering only the additive group structure)
- **Similar structures**: Linear transformations between vector spaces, which are homomorphisms of vector space structures
