# Ideal {#def-ideal}

An **ideal** is a special [Subset](../logic-set-theory/def-subset.qmd) of a [Ring](def-ring.qmd) that is closed under ring addition and absorbs multiplication by ring elements.

## Formal Definition

Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a ring. A subset $I \subseteq R$ is called:

### Left Ideal

A **left ideal** if:
1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
2. For all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$: $r \cdot a \in I$ (left absorption)

### Right Ideal

A **right ideal** if:
1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
2. For all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$: $a \cdot r \in I$ (right absorption)

### Two-Sided Ideal

A **two-sided ideal** (or simply **ideal**) if it is both a left ideal and a right ideal:
1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
2. For all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$: both $r \cdot a \in I$ and $a \cdot r \in I$

## Properties

- In commutative rings, all three definitions coincide
- The trivial ideals are $\{0\}$ and $R$ itself
- Ideals are closed under finite sums and differences
- The intersection of any collection of ideals is an ideal
- For rings with unity, $I = R$ if and only if $1 \in I$
- Not every ideal is a [subring](def-subring.qmd): an ideal $I$ is a subring if and only if $1 \in I$ (which implies $I = R$)

## Connection to Modules

- Left ideals of $R$ are precisely the left $R$-[submodules](def-module.qmd) of $R$ (viewed as a left module over itself)
- Right ideals of $R$ are precisely the right $R$-submodules of $R$
- This perspective unifies ideal theory with [module](def-module.qmd) theory

## Types of Ideals

- **Principal ideal**: Generated by a single element $a$, denoted $(a)$ (see [example](ex-principal-ideal.qmd))
- **[Prime ideal](def-prime-ideal.qmd)**: $P$ where $ab \in P$ implies $a \in P$ or $b \in P$
- **[Maximal ideal](def-maximal-ideal.qmd)**: Proper ideal not contained in any other proper ideal

## Examples

- In $\mathbb{Z}$: The even integers $2\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...\}$
- In [polynomial ring](def-polynomial-ring.qmd) $K[x]$: The set of polynomials with zero constant term
- In matrix ring $M_n(K)$: The set of matrices with zero first row

## Quotient Rings and the First Isomorphism Theorem

Just as [normal subgroups](def-normal-subgroup.qmd) allow us to form [quotient groups](def-quotient-group.qmd), ideals allow us to form [quotient rings](def-quotient-ring.qmd). For a ring $R$ and ideal $I$:

- The quotient ring $R/I$ consists of cosets $\{r + I : r \in R\}$
- Ring operations: $(r + I) + (s + I) = (r + s) + I$ and $(r + I)(s + I) = rs + I$
- The kernel of a [ring homomorphism](def-ring-homomorphism.qmd) is always an ideal

The [First Isomorphism Theorem](thm-first-isomorphism.qmd) extends to rings: if $\phi: R \to S$ is a [ring homomorphism](def-ring-homomorphism.qmd), then $R/\ker(\phi) \cong \text{Im}(\phi)$ as rings. This fundamental result shows that every homomorphic image of a ring is [isomorphic](def-isomorphism.qmd) to a quotient ring.
