# First Isomorphism Theorem {#thm-first-isomorphism}

The **First Isomorphism Theorem** (also known as the **Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem**) establishes a fundamental relationship between [Group Homomorphism](def-homomorphism.qmd), [Kernel](def-kernel.qmd), and [Quotient Group](def-quotient-group.qmd). It states that every homomorphic image is isomorphic to a quotient group.

## Statement

Let $\phi: G \to H$ be a group homomorphism. Then:

$$G/\ker(\phi) \cong \text{Im}(\phi)$$

where:
- $\ker(\phi) = \{g \in G : \phi(g) = e_H\}$ is the kernel of $\phi$
- $\text{Im}(\phi) = \{\phi(g) : g \in G\}$ is the image of $\phi$
- $G/\ker(\phi)$ is the quotient group of $G$ by $\ker(\phi)$

## Formal Statement

More precisely, there exists an isomorphism $\bar{\phi}: G/\ker(\phi) \to \text{Im}(\phi)$ defined by:

$$\bar{\phi}(g\ker(\phi)) = \phi(g)$$

for all $g \in G$.

## Key Insights

1. **Natural Partitioning**: The homomorphism $\phi$ naturally partitions $G$ into cosets of $\ker(\phi)$, where elements in the same coset map to the same element in $H$.

2. **Well-Defined Map**: The map $\bar{\phi}$ is well-defined because if $g_1\ker(\phi) = g_2\ker(\phi)$, then $g_1^{-1}g_2 \in \ker(\phi)$, which implies $\phi(g_1) = \phi(g_2)$.

3. **Structure Preservation**: The theorem shows that homomorphisms "collapse" the kernel while preserving the group structure in the image.

## Proof Outline

The proof consists of four main steps:

### Step 1: Well-Defined
If $g\ker(\phi) = g'\ker(\phi)$, then $g' = gk$ for some $k \in \ker(\phi)$. Thus:
$$\phi(g') = \phi(gk) = \phi(g)\phi(k) = \phi(g)e_H = \phi(g)$$

### Step 2: Homomorphism
For any $g_1, g_2 \in G$:
$$\bar{\phi}(g_1\ker(\phi) \cdot g_2\ker(\phi)) = \bar{\phi}(g_1g_2\ker(\phi)) = \phi(g_1g_2) = \phi(g_1)\phi(g_2) = \bar{\phi}(g_1\ker(\phi)) \cdot \bar{\phi}(g_2\ker(\phi))$$

### Step 3: Surjectivity
For any $h \in \text{Im}(\phi)$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $\phi(g) = h$. Then $\bar{\phi}(g\ker(\phi)) = h$.

### Step 4: Injectivity
If $\bar{\phi}(g\ker(\phi)) = e_H$, then $\phi(g) = e_H$, so $g \in \ker(\phi)$, which means $g\ker(\phi) = \ker(\phi)$ (the identity in $G/\ker(\phi)$).

## Applications

The First Isomorphism Theorem has numerous important applications:

1. **Classification of Groups**: To prove that a quotient group $G/N$ is isomorphic to a group $H$, it suffices to find a surjective homomorphism $\phi: G \to H$ with kernel $N$.

2. **Proving Group Properties**: Many group-theoretic results can be proved by constructing appropriate homomorphisms and applying this theorem.

3. **Computing Quotient Groups**: The theorem provides a concrete way to understand quotient groups through homomorphic images.

### Example Applications

- **Integers Modulo n**: The natural projection $\pi: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has kernel $n\mathbb{Z}$, so $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}_n$.

- **Abelianization**: For any group $G$, the quotient $G/[G,G]$ (where $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup) is the largest [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd) quotient of $G$.

## Connection to Exact Sequences

The First Isomorphism Theorem can be elegantly expressed using [exact sequences](def-exact-sequence.qmd). For any group homomorphism $\phi: G \to H$, we have the short exact sequence:

$$0 \to \ker(\phi) \xrightarrow{i} G \xrightarrow{\phi} \text{Im}(\phi) \to 0$$

where $i$ is the inclusion map. The First Isomorphism Theorem then states that this exact sequence induces an isomorphism $G/\ker(\phi) \cong \text{Im}(\phi)$.

## Related Theorems

The First Isomorphism Theorem is part of a family of isomorphism theorems:
- **Second Isomorphism Theorem** (Diamond Isomorphism Theorem)
- **Third Isomorphism Theorem** (Correspondence Theorem)
- **Fourth Isomorphism Theorem** (Lattice Isomorphism Theorem)

These theorems together provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationships between subgroups, normal subgroups, and quotient groups.

## Historical Note

The isomorphism theorems were formulated in their modern generality by Emmy Noether in her 1927 paper "Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und FunktionenkÃ¶rpern". Less general versions appeared in earlier work by Richard Dedekind and in previous papers by Noether.
