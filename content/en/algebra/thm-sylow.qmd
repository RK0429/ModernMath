The **Sylow Theorems** are fundamental results in finite [group theory](def-group.qmd) that provide detailed information about the existence and properties of [subgroups](def-subgroup.qmd) of [prime](../number-theory/def-prime.qmd) power order.

## Preliminaries

Let $G$ be a finite [group](def-group.qmd) with order $|G| = p^k m$ where $p$ is a [prime](../number-theory/def-prime.qmd), $k \geq 1$, and $\gcd(p, m) = 1$.

A **Sylow $p$-subgroup** of $G$ is a [subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) of order $p^k$ (the highest power of $p$ [dividing](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) $|G|$).

## The Three Sylow Theorems

### First Sylow Theorem (Existence)

For any integer $r$ with $0 \leq r \leq k$, there exists a [subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) of $G$ of order $p^r$. In particular:
- $G$ contains at least one Sylow $p$-subgroup for each [prime](../number-theory/def-prime.qmd) factor of $|G|$

### Second Sylow Theorem (Conjugacy)

All Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are conjugate to each other. That is, if $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$, then there exists $g \in G$ such that:
$$Q = gPg^{-1}$$

### Third Sylow Theorem (Counting)

Let $n_p$ denote the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$. Then:

1. $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
2. $n_p$ [divides](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) $m$ (the part of $|G|$ coprime to $p$)
3. $n_p = [G : N_G(P)]$ where $N_G(P)$ is the normalizer of any Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$

## Key Consequences

### Normal Sylow Subgroups

If $n_p = 1$, then the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup is [normal](def-normal-subgroup.qmd) in $G$.

### Divisibility Relations

Combining the conditions from the third theorem: $n_p$ must satisfy both $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and $n_p | m$. This severely restricts the possible values of $n_p$.

### Cauchy's Theorem

As a special case when $r = 1$: If a [prime](../number-theory/def-prime.qmd) $p$ [divides](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) $|G|$, then $G$ contains an element of order $p$.

## Applications

The Sylow theorems have numerous applications:

1. **Classification of finite groups**: Used to prove that groups of certain orders must have specific structures
2. **Non-simplicity results**: Often used to show that groups of particular orders cannot be [simple](def-simple-group.qmd)
3. **Structural analysis**: Provides information about the [normal subgroup](def-normal-subgroup.qmd) structure
4. **Partial converse to Lagrange**: While [Lagrange's theorem](thm-lagrange.qmd) states that subgroup orders divide the group order, Sylow's first theorem provides a partial converse for prime powers

## Example: Groups of Order 15

Let $|G| = 15 = 3 \cdot 5$. By the Sylow theorems:

- $n_3 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ and $n_3 | 5$, so $n_3 \in \{1, 5\}$. But 5 ≢ 1 (mod 3), so $n_3 = 1$
- $n_5 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ and $n_5 | 3$, so $n_5 \in \{1, 3\}$. But 3 ≢ 1 (mod 5), so $n_5 = 1$

Since both Sylow subgroups are unique, they are [normal](def-normal-subgroup.qmd), and $G$ must be [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd) (in fact, [cyclic](def-cyclic-group.qmd)).

## Historical Note

The theorems are named after Peter Ludwig Sylow (1832-1918), a Norwegian mathematician who proved them in 1872. They remain among the most powerful tools in finite group theory.
