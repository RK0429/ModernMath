# Group Homomorphism {#def-homomorphism}

A **group homomorphism** is a [function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) between two [Group](def-group.qmd) structures that preserves the group [Binary Operation](def-binary-operation.qmd).

## Formal Definition

Let $(G, \cdot)$ and $(H, *)$ be groups. A function $f: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism if:

$$f(a \cdot b) = f(a) * f(b)$$

for all $a, b \in G$.

## Properties

For any group homomorphism $f: G \to H$:

1. **Identity preservation**: $f(e_G) = e_H$ where $e_G$ and $e_H$ are the identity elements
2. **Inverse preservation**: $f(a^{-1}) = f(a)^{-1}$ for all $a \in G$
3. **Subgroup preservation**: If $K \leq G$, then $f(K) \leq H$

## Special Types

- **[Monomorphism](../category-theory/def-monomorphism.qmd)**: An injective homomorphism
- **[Epimorphism](../category-theory/def-epimorphism.qmd)**: A surjective homomorphism
- **[Isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd)**: A bijective homomorphism
- **[Endomorphism](def-endomorphism.qmd)**: A homomorphism from a group to itself
- **[Automorphism](def-automorphism.qmd)**: A bijective endomorphism (the set of all automorphisms forms a group that [acts](def-group-action.qmd) on $G$)

## Kernel and Image

For a homomorphism $f: G \to H$:

- The **kernel** is $\ker(f) = \{g \in G : f(g) = e_H\}$
- The **image** is $\text{Im}(f) = \{f(g) : g \in G\}$

The kernel is always a normal subgroup of $G$, which allows us to form the quotient group $G/\ker(f)$.

## First Isomorphism Theorem

The fundamental relationship between homomorphisms and quotient groups is given by the [First Isomorphism Theorem](thm-first-isomorphism.qmd):

$$G/\ker(f) \cong \text{Im}(f)$$

This shows that every homomorphic image is essentially a quotient group. See @def-quotient-group and @thm-first-isomorphism for more details.
