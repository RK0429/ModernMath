# Subring {#def-subring}

A **subring** of a [Ring](def-ring.qmd) $R$ is a [Set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) $S \subseteq R$ that is itself a ring under the same operations as $R$.

## Formal Definition

Let $(R, +, \cdot)$ be a ring. A non-empty subset $S \subseteq R$ is a subring of $R$ if:

1. **Additive subgroup**: $(S, +)$ is a [subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) of $(R, +)$
2. **Multiplicative closure**: For all $a, b \in S$, we have $a \cdot b \in S$

Equivalently, $S$ is a subring of $R$ if and only if:
- $S$ is non-empty
- For all $a, b \in S$: $a - b \in S$ (closed under subtraction)
- For all $a, b \in S$: $a \cdot b \in S$ (closed under multiplication)

## Subring Test

A subset $S$ of a ring $R$ is a subring if and only if:
- $S \neq \emptyset$
- $S$ is closed under subtraction
- $S$ is closed under multiplication

This test is often more practical than verifying all ring axioms.

## Properties

- Every ring $R$ has at least two subrings: the zero ring $\{0\}$ and $R$ itself
- The intersection of any collection of subrings is a subring
- If $R$ has unity $1_R$, then a subring $S$ with unity must have $1_S = 1_R$
- Every subring of a commutative ring is commutative
- Every subring of an integral domain is an integral domain

## Examples

### Number Systems
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Q}$, which is a subring of $\mathbb{R}$, which is a subring of $\mathbb{C}$
- $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b\sqrt{2} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{R}$

### Polynomial Rings
- $R$ is a subring of $R[x]$ (identifying $R$ with constant polynomials)
- $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Q}[x]$
- The set of polynomials with zero constant term forms a subring of $R[x]$

### Special Subrings
- The **center** of a ring $R$ is the subring $Z(R) = \{c \in R : cr = rc \text{ for all } r \in R\}$ (analogous to the [center of a group](def-center-of-group.qmd))
- For matrix ring $M_n(R)$, the scalar matrices $\{aI : a \in R\}$ form a subring isomorphic to $R$

## Relation to Ideals

Not every [ideal](def-ideal.qmd) is a subring:
- An ideal $I$ of $R$ is a subring if and only if $1 \in I$
- If $1 \in I$ for an ideal $I$, then $I = R$

## Subring Generated by a Set

For any subset $X \subseteq R$, the **subring generated by $X$** is the smallest subring containing $X$:
$$\langle X \rangle = \bigcap \{S : S \text{ is a subring of } R \text{ and } X \subseteq S\}$$
