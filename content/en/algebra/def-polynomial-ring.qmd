# Polynomial Ring {#def-polynomial-ring}

A **polynomial ring** is a [Ring](def-ring.qmd) formed from the set of polynomials in one or more indeterminates with coefficients in another ring.

## Formal Definition

Let $R$ be a ring. The polynomial ring in one indeterminate $x$ over $R$, denoted $R[x]$, consists of all formal expressions:

$$p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^n$$

where:
- $a_i \in R$ for all $i$
- Only finitely many $a_i$ are non-zero
- The largest $n$ with $a_n \neq 0$ is called the **degree** of $p(x)$

### Ring Operations

Two polynomials are equal if and only if all corresponding coefficients are equal.

**Addition**: $(a_0 + a_1x + \cdots) + (b_0 + b_1x + \cdots) = (a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1)x + \cdots$

**Multiplication**: $(a_0 + a_1x + \cdots)(b_0 + b_1x + \cdots) = c_0 + c_1x + \cdots$ where:
$$c_k = \sum_{i+j=k} a_ib_j$$

## Key Properties

### Algebraic Structure

1. If $R$ has unity $1_R$, then $R[x]$ has unity (the constant polynomial $1_R$)
2. If $R$ is commutative, then $R[x]$ is commutative
3. If $R$ is an [integral domain](def-integral-domain.qmd), then $R[x]$ is an [integral domain](def-integral-domain.qmd)

### Degree Properties

For non-zero polynomials $f, g \in R[x]$:
- $\deg(f + g) \leq \max(\deg(f), \deg(g))$
- If $R$ is an [integral domain](def-integral-domain.qmd): $\deg(fg) = \deg(f) + \deg(g)$

### Division Algorithm

When $R$ is a [Field](def-field.qmd), for any $f, g \in R[x]$ with $g \neq 0$, there exist unique polynomials $q, r \in R[x]$ such that:
$$f = gq + r$$
where either $r = 0$ or $\deg(r) < \deg(g)$.

## Multiple Indeterminates

The polynomial ring in $n$ indeterminates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ over $R$ is denoted $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ and can be constructed recursively:
$$R[x_1, \ldots, x_n] = (R[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$$

## Important Results

### Unique Factorization

If $R$ is a unique factorization domain (UFD), then $R[x]$ is also a UFD. In particular:
- If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a UFD
- Every non-zero polynomial in $F[x]$ factors uniquely into irreducible polynomials

### Root Theorem

For a field $F$ and $f \in F[x]$: $c \in F$ is a root of $f$ if and only if $(x - c)$ [divides](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) $f(x)$.

## Examples

- $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ - polynomials with integer coefficients (forms a [subring](def-subring.qmd) of $\mathbb{Q}[x]$)
- $\mathbb{R}[x]$ - polynomials with real coefficients
- $\mathbb{C}[x, y]$ - polynomials in two variables over complex numbers
- $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ - polynomials over the finite field of $p$ elements

## Applications

Polynomial rings are fundamental in:
- **Algebraic geometry**: Coordinate rings of algebraic varieties
- **Number theory**: Algebraic integers and field extensions
- **Coding theory**: Reed-Solomon codes and cyclic codes
- **Computer algebra**: Symbolic computation and algebraic algorithms
