# Cyclic Group {#def-cyclic-group}

A **cyclic group** is a [group](def-group.qmd) $G$ that can be generated by a single element. That is, there exists an element $g \in G$ such that every element of $G$ can be expressed as a power of $g$.

## Formal Definition

A group $(G, \cdot)$ is cyclic if there exists $g \in G$ such that
$$G = \{g^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

We write $G = \langle g \rangle$ and say that $g$ **generates** $G$ or that $g$ is a **generator** of $G$.

## Notation for Powers

In a cyclic group $G = \langle g \rangle$:
- $g^0 = e$ (the [identity element](def-identity-element.qmd))
- $g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdot \ldots \cdot g}_{n \text{ times}}$ for positive $n$
- $g^{-n} = (g^{-1})^n$ for positive $n$

For additive groups, we use:
- $ng$ instead of $g^n$
- $0g = 0$ (the additive identity)
- $(-n)g = n(-g)$ for positive $n$

## Order of a Cyclic Group

A cyclic group can be:
- **Finite**: If the [cardinality](../logic-set-theory/def-cardinality.qmd) $|G| = n$ for some positive integer $n$, then $G = \{e, g, g^2, \ldots, g^{n-1}\}$
- **Infinite**: If no positive power of $g$ equals the identity

## Important Properties

1. **[Abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd)**: Every cyclic group is [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd) (commutative)
   - For any $a, b \in G$, we have $a = g^m$ and $b = g^n$ for some $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$
   - Thus $ab = g^m g^n = g^{m+n} = g^{n+m} = g^n g^m = ba$

2. **Subgroups**: Every [subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) of a cyclic group is cyclic

3. **Isomorphism Classes**:
   - Every infinite cyclic group is [isomorphic](def-isomorphism.qmd) to $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$
   - Every finite cyclic group of [order](def-order.qmd) $n$ is [isomorphic](def-isomorphism.qmd) to $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}, +)$

4. **Generators**:
   - A cyclic group of [order](def-order.qmd) $n$ has $\phi(n)$ generators, where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function (which can be computed using the [Inclusion-Exclusion Principle](../combinatorics/thm-inclusion-exclusion.qmd))
   - For infinite cyclic groups, only $g$ and $g^{-1}$ are generators

## Examples

### Finite Cyclic Groups
- $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ under addition, generated by $\overline{1}$
- The group of $n$-th roots of unity under multiplication, generated by $e^{2\pi i/n}$
- The rotation group of a regular $n$-gon

### Infinite Cyclic Groups
- $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ generated by $1$ (or by $-1$)
- The group of powers of 2 under multiplication: $\{2^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$

## Classification

The classification of cyclic groups is particularly simple:
- Up to [isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd), there is exactly one cyclic group of each [order](def-order.qmd) (finite or infinite)
- Two cyclic groups are [isomorphic](def-isomorphism.qmd) if and only if they have the same [order](def-order.qmd)

## Products of Cyclic Groups

The [direct product](def-direct-product.qmd) of cyclic groups has special properties:
- $\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n$ is cyclic if and only if $\gcd(m,n) = 1$
- When $\gcd(m,n) = 1$, we have $\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n \cong \mathbb{Z}_{mn}$
- In general, $\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n \cong \mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(m,n)} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\text{lcm}(m,n)}$ (see @../number-theory/def-lcm)
