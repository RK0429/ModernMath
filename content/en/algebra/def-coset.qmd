# Definition: Coset {#def-coset}

A **coset** is a fundamental concept in group theory that arises when we translate a [subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) by a fixed element of the parent [group](def-group.qmd). Cosets partition a group into equal-sized disjoint subsets.

## Formal Definition

Let $(G, \star)$ be a group and $H \leq G$ be a subgroup. For any element $g \in G$:

### Left Coset

The **left coset** of $H$ by $g$ is the set:
$$gH = \{g \star h : h \in H\}$$

### Right Coset

The **right coset** of $H$ by $g$ is the set:
$$Hg = \{h \star g : h \in H\}$$

## Notation and Terminology

- The element $g$ is called a **representative** of the coset
- When the operation is addition, we write $g + H$ and $H + g$
- When the operation is multiplication, we often omit the symbol: $gH$ and $Hg$
- The set of all left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is denoted $G/H$ (read "$G$ modulo $H$")
- The set of all right cosets of $H$ in $G$ is denoted $H\backslash G$

## Fundamental Properties

### 1. Equal Cardinality

Every coset of $H$ has the same [cardinality](../logic-set-theory/def-cardinality.qmd) as $H$:
$$|gH| = |H| = |Hg|$$

This follows from the fact that the map $h \mapsto gh$ is a bijection from $H$ to $gH$.

### 2. Partition Property

The left cosets (and separately, the right cosets) of $H$ partition $G$:
- Every element of $G$ belongs to exactly one left coset
- Two left cosets are either identical or disjoint: $g_1H = g_2H$ or $g_1H \cap g_2H = \emptyset$

This partition arises from an [equivalence relation](../logic-set-theory/def-equivalence-relation.qmd): $g_1 \sim g_2$ if and only if $g_1^{-1}g_2 \in H$.

### 3. Coset Equality Criterion

For any $g_1, g_2 \in G$:
- $g_1H = g_2H$ if and only if $g_1^{-1}g_2 \in H$
- $Hg_1 = Hg_2$ if and only if $g_1g_2^{-1} \in H$

### 4. The Identity Coset

The subgroup $H$ itself is always a coset:
- $eH = H = He$ where $e$ is the identity element

### 5. Index

The number of distinct left cosets equals the number of distinct right cosets. This common value is called the **index** of $H$ in $G$, denoted $[G:H]$.

## Examples

### Example 1: Integers Modulo n

Consider $G = (\mathbb{Z}, +)$ and $H = n\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, ...\}$.

The left cosets are:
- $0 + n\mathbb{Z} = n\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, ...\}$
- $1 + n\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2n+1, -n+1, 1, n+1, 2n+1, ...\}$
- $2 + n\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2n+2, -n+2, 2, n+2, 2n+2, ...\}$
- ...
- $(n-1) + n\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -n-1, -1, n-1, 2n-1, 3n-1, ...\}$

There are exactly $n$ distinct cosets, so $[\mathbb{Z} : n\mathbb{Z}] = n$.

### Example 2: Even Integers in Z

Let $H = 2\mathbb{Z}$ (even integers) in $G = \mathbb{Z}$.

The cosets are:
- $0 + 2\mathbb{Z} = 2\mathbb{Z}$ (all even integers)
- $1 + 2\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, ...\}$ (all odd integers)

Thus $[\mathbb{Z} : 2\mathbb{Z}] = 2$.

### Example 3: Cosets in a Finite Group

In the dihedral group $D_3$ (symmetries of an equilateral triangle) with subgroup $H = \{e, r\}$ (where $r$ is a 120Â° rotation):

The left cosets are:
- $eH = \{e, r\} = H$
- $r^2H = \{r^2, r^2r\} = \{r^2, e\} = H$
- $sH = \{s, sr\}$ (where $s$ is a reflection)

## Geometric Interpretation

Cosets can be visualized as:
- **Translations**: Each coset $gH$ is a "translate" of $H$ by the element $g$
- **Parallel subsets**: In [abelian groups](def-abelian-group.qmd), cosets are like parallel lines or planes
- **Orbits**: Cosets represent the orbits of a natural group action

## When Left and Right Cosets Coincide

In general, $gH \neq Hg$. However, they coincide in two important cases:

1. **[Abelian Groups](def-abelian-group.qmd)**: If $G$ is [abelian](def-abelian-group.qmd), then $gH = Hg$ for all $g \in G$

2. **Normal Subgroups**: A subgroup $N$ is normal if and only if $gN = Ng$ for all $g \in G$

## Connection to Quotient Groups

When $N$ is a [normal subgroup](def-normal-subgroup.qmd), the set of cosets $G/N$ can be given a group structure, forming the [quotient group](def-quotient-group.qmd). The group operation is:
$$(gN) \star (hN) = (g \star h)N$$

This operation is well-defined precisely because left and right cosets coincide for normal subgroups.

## Applications

### Lagrange's Theorem

The concept of cosets is central to [Lagrange's theorem](thm-lagrange.qmd), which states that for a finite group $G$, the [cardinality](../logic-set-theory/def-cardinality.qmd) of $G$ is:
$$|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]$$

### Group Actions

Cosets naturally arise in the study of [group actions](def-group-action.qmd):
- The left cosets of $H$ are the orbits of $H$ acting on $G$ by right multiplication
- The right cosets of $H$ are the orbits of $H$ acting on $G$ by left multiplication

### Counting Arguments

Cosets provide a powerful tool for counting in finite groups and proving [divisibility](../number-theory/def-divisibility.qmd) results.
