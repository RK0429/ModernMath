# Normal Subgroup {#def-normal-subgroup}

A **normal subgroup** is a @def-subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by any element of the parent @def-group.

## Formal Definition

Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $H \leq G$ be a subgroup. We say that $H$ is a **normal subgroup** of $G$, denoted $H \triangleleft G$, if and only if:

$$gHg^{-1} = H \text{ for all } g \in G$$

where $gHg^{-1} = \{ghg^{-1} : h \in H\}$ is the conjugate of $H$ by $g$. This is a special case of a [group action](def-group-action.qmd), specifically the conjugation action of $G$ on its subgroups. The map $h \mapsto ghg^{-1}$ is an inner [automorphism](def-automorphism.qmd) of $G$.

## Equivalent Characterizations

The following conditions are equivalent for a subgroup $H$ of $G$:

1. $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$
2. $gHg^{-1} \subseteq H$ for all $g \in G$
3. $gH = Hg$ for all $g \in G$ (left and right [cosets](def-coset.qmd) coincide)
4. The conjugacy class of each element of $H$ is contained in $H$
5. $H$ is the kernel of some @def-homomorphism from $G$

## Properties

### Trivial Normal Subgroups

Every group $G$ has at least two normal subgroups:
- The trivial subgroup $\{e\} \triangleleft G$
- The improper subgroup $G \triangleleft G$

A group whose only normal subgroups are these two trivial ones is called a [simple group](def-simple-group.qmd).

### Normal Subgroups in Abelian Groups

If $G$ is an [abelian group](def-abelian-group.qmd), then every subgroup of $G$ is normal. This is because for abelian groups:
$$ghg^{-1} = gg^{-1}h = eh = h$$
for all $g \in G$ and $h \in H$.

### Index 2 Subgroups

If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ with index $[G:H] = 2$, then $H$ is normal in $G$. This is because there are only two [cosets](def-coset.qmd): $H$ and $G \setminus H$.

### Non-transitivity

Normality is not transitive: if $K \triangleleft H$ and $H \triangleleft G$, it does not necessarily follow that $K \triangleleft G$.

## Examples

1. **Center of a Group**: The [center](def-center-of-group.qmd) $Z(G) = \{g \in G : gx = xg \text{ for all } x \in G\}$ is always a normal subgroup of $G$.

2. **Alternating Group**: The alternating group $A_n$ is a normal subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$ for all $n \geq 2$, since $[S_n : A_n] = 2$.

3. **Even Integers**: The subgroup $2\mathbb{Z}$ of even integers is normal in $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$.

4. **Special Linear Group**: $SL_n(\mathbb{R}) = \{A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R}) : \det(A) = 1\}$ is normal in $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, where $\det$ denotes the [determinant](def-determinant.qmd).

## Applications

Normal subgroups are fundamental in group theory because:
- They are precisely the subgroups that can be used to construct quotient groups
- They are the kernels of group homomorphisms
- They play a crucial role in the classification of groups
- The [Sylow theorems](thm-sylow.qmd) often help identify when certain subgroups must be normal
