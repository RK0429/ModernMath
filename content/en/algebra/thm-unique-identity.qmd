# Uniqueness of Identity {#thm-unique-identity}

Let $(G, \star)$ be a [Group](def-group.qmd). Then the identity element is unique.

## Statement

If $e$ and $e'$ are both identity elements in $G$, then $e = e'$.

## Proof

Suppose $e$ and $e'$ are both identity elements in the group $(G, \star)$.

Since $e$ is an identity element, for all $a \in G$:
$$a \star e = e \star a = a$$

Since $e'$ is an identity element, for all $a \in G$:
$$a \star e' = e' \star a = a$$

Now consider the element $e \star e'$:

1. Since $e'$ is an identity, we have: $e \star e' = e$
2. Since $e$ is an identity, we have: $e \star e' = e'$

Therefore, $e = e \star e' = e'$.

Thus, the identity element is unique. $\square$

## Consequences

This theorem justifies our use of "the" identity element rather than "an" identity element when discussing groups. We often denote the unique identity element as:

- $e$ or $1$ in multiplicative notation
- $0$ in additive notation
