# Group {#def-group}

A **group** is a [set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) $G$ together with a [binary operation](def-binary-operation.qmd) $\star: G \times G \to G$ that satisfies the following axioms:

## Group Axioms

1. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$,
   $$(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$$

2. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$,
   $$a \star e = e \star a = a$$

3. **Inverse elements**: For each $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that
   $$a \star b = b \star a = e$$
   where $e$ is the identity element. We denote this inverse as $a^{-1}$.

## Notation

- A group is often denoted as $(G, \star)$ to explicitly show both the set and the operation
- When the operation is clear from context, we may simply write $G$
- The operation symbol is often omitted: $ab$ instead of $a \star b$

## Important Properties

From these axioms, we can prove:

- The identity element is unique
- Each element has a unique inverse
- Cancellation laws hold: if $ab = ac$ then $b = c$
- Every group has a [center](def-center-of-group.qmd) $Z(G)$, consisting of elements that commute with all elements of $G$

## Relationship to Other Structures

A group is a [monoid](def-monoid.qmd) where every element has an [inverse](def-inverse-element.qmd). Equivalently, a group can be seen as a special type of monoid with the additional inverse property.

## Examples

- $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$: The integers under addition
- $(\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$: The non-zero rationals under multiplication
- $(GL_n(\mathbb{R}), \cdot)$: The invertible $n \times n$ matrices under matrix multiplication

## Special Types of Groups

- **Abelian group**: A group where the operation is commutative (see @def-abelian-group)
- **Finite group**: A group with finite [order](def-order.qmd) (finitely many elements)
- **Cyclic group**: A group generated by a single element (see @def-cyclic-group)
- **Simple group**: A group with no proper non-trivial normal subgroups (see @def-simple-group)
