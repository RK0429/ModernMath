# Definition: Semigroup {#def-semigroup}

A **semigroup** is a [set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) $S$ together with a [binary operation](def-binary-operation.qmd) $\star: S \times S \to S$ that satisfies a single fundamental axiom.

## Semigroup Axiom

**[Associativity](def-associativity.qmd)**: For all $a, b, c \in S$,
$$(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$$

## Notation

- A semigroup is often denoted as $(S, \star)$ to explicitly show the set and operation
- When the operation is clear from context, we may simply write $S$
- The operation symbol is often omitted: $ab$ instead of $a \star b$
- Common operation symbols include $\cdot$ (multiplication), $+$ (addition), $\circ$ (composition)

## Important Properties

From the associativity axiom:

- We can unambiguously write products of multiple elements without parentheses: $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n$
- Semigroups are closed under their operation (by definition of binary operation)
- Subsemigroups can be formed from subsets closed under the operation
- The set of [endomorphisms](def-endomorphism.qmd) of any object forms a semigroup under composition

## Relationship to Other Structures

- **[Monoid](def-monoid.qmd)**: A semigroup with an [identity element](def-identity-element.qmd)
- **[Group](def-group.qmd)**: A monoid where every element has an [inverse](def-inverse-element.qmd)
- **Commutative semigroup**: A semigroup whose operation is [commutative](def-commutativity.qmd)
- **Band**: A semigroup where every element is idempotent ($a \star a = a$)

## Examples

### Numeric Semigroups
- $(\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}, +)$: Positive integers under addition (no identity 0)
- $(\mathbb{Z}, \cdot)$: All integers under multiplication
- $(\mathbb{R}^+, \cdot)$: Positive real numbers under multiplication
- $(2\mathbb{N}, +)$: Even positive integers under addition

### Function Semigroups
- Transformations of a set under composition (not all bijective)
- Partial functions from a set to itself under composition
- Binary relations on a set under composition

### Matrix Semigroups
- Square [matrices](def-matrix.qmd) of fixed size under multiplication
- Matrices with non-negative entries under multiplication
- Upper triangular matrices under multiplication

### Other Examples
- Strings over an alphabet under concatenation (forms the free semigroup)
- The set $\{0\}$ under multiplication (trivial semigroup)
- The set of all [ideals](def-ideal.qmd) in a [ring](def-ring.qmd) under multiplication

## Special Types of Semigroups

### Regular Semigroups
A semigroup $S$ is **regular** if for every $a \in S$, there exists $x \in S$ such that $a = axa$.

### Inverse Semigroups
A semigroup where every element has a unique "pseudo-inverse" satisfying certain conditions.

### Cancellative Semigroups
A semigroup satisfying the cancellation laws:
- Left cancellative: $ab = ac \implies b = c$
- Right cancellative: $ba = ca \implies b = c$

### Finite Semigroups
Semigroups with finitely many elements, important in automata theory and computer science.

## Applications

Semigroups appear throughout mathematics and its applications:

- **Algebra**: Foundation for more complex algebraic structures
- **Computer Science**: Finite semigroups correspond to finite automata; used in formal language theory
- **Analysis**: Operator semigroups in functional analysis and PDEs
- **Probability**: Markov semigroups in stochastic processes
- **Combinatorics**: Counting problems involving associative operations

## Historical Note

The concept of a semigroup emerged in the early 20th century as mathematicians began studying algebraic structures systematically. The term "semi-group" reflects that it satisfies only part of the group axiomsâ€”specifically, associativity.
