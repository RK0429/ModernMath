# Definition: Basis {#def-basis}

Let $V$ be a [Vector Space](def-vector-space.qmd) over a field $F$. A subset $B \subseteq V$ is called a **basis** for $V$ if:

1. $B$ is [linearly independent](def-linear-independence.qmd)
2. $B$ [spans](def-span.qmd) $V$ (i.e., $\text{span}(B) = V$)

## Equivalent Characterizations

The following are equivalent for a subset $B$ of a vector space $V$:

1. $B$ is a basis for $V$
2. $B$ is a maximal linearly independent set in $V$
3. $B$ is a minimal spanning set for $V$
4. Every vector in $V$ can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of vectors in $B$

## Types of Bases

- **Standard basis**: For $\mathbb{R}^n$, the standard basis is $\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n\}$ where $\mathbf{e}_i$ has 1 in the $i$-th position and 0 elsewhere
- **Ordered basis**: A basis with a specified ordering of its elements
- **Orthonormal basis**: In an inner product space, a basis where all vectors have unit length and are mutually orthogonal

## Dimension

If $V$ has a finite basis with $n$ elements, then:
- Every basis of $V$ has exactly $n$ elements
- We say $V$ has **dimension** $n$, written $\dim(V) = n$
- If no finite basis exists, $V$ is **infinite-dimensional**

The concept of basis is fundamental to linear algebra, providing a coordinate system for vector spaces.
