# Prime Ideal {#def-prime-ideal}

A **prime ideal** is an [ideal](def-ideal.qmd) that generalizes the notion of prime numbers to arbitrary [rings](def-ring.qmd). It is characterized by the property that whenever a product belongs to the ideal, at least one of the factors must belong to the ideal.

## Formal Definition

Let $R$ be a [ring](def-ring.qmd). An [ideal](def-ideal.qmd) $P \subseteq R$ is called a **prime ideal** if:

1. $P \neq R$ (proper ideal)
2. For all $a, b \in R$: if $ab \in P$, then $a \in P$ or $b \in P$

## Equivalent Characterizations

### Quotient Ring Characterization

An ideal $P$ in a ring $R$ is prime if and only if the [quotient ring](def-quotient-ring.qmd) $R/P$ is an [integral domain](def-integral-domain.qmd).

**Proof**:
- ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $P$ is prime. Let $(a + P)(b + P) = 0 + P$ in $R/P$. Then $ab \in P$, so either $a \in P$ or $b \in P$, meaning either $a + P = 0 + P$ or $b + P = 0 + P$.
- ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $R/P$ is an integral domain. If $ab \in P$, then $(a + P)(b + P) = ab + P = 0 + P$. Since $R/P$ has no [zero divisors](def-zero-divisor.qmd), either $a + P = 0 + P$ or $b + P = 0 + P$, so either $a \in P$ or $b \in P$.

### Complement Characterization

An ideal $P$ is prime if and only if its complement $R \setminus P$ is multiplicatively closed:
- If $a, b \in R \setminus P$, then $ab \in R \setminus P$

## Properties

- Every [maximal ideal](def-maximal-ideal.qmd) is prime (but not every prime ideal is maximal)
- The zero ideal $(0)$ is prime if and only if $R$ is an [integral domain](def-integral-domain.qmd)
- The intersection of all prime ideals containing an ideal $I$ is called the radical of $I$
- In a commutative ring with unity, every nonzero prime ideal contains at least one prime element

## Examples

### In the Integers

In $\mathbb{Z}$:
- The ideal $(p) = p\mathbb{Z}$ is prime if and only if $p$ is a prime number or $p = 0$
- $(0)$ is prime since $\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain
- $(4)$ is not prime since $2 \cdot 2 \in (4)$ but $2 \notin (4)$

### In Polynomial Rings

In $\mathbb{R}[x]$:
- $(x)$ is prime: if $f(x)g(x) \in (x)$, then $f(0)g(0) = 0$, so $f(0) = 0$ or $g(0) = 0$
- $(x^2 + 1)$ is prime since $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1) \cong \mathbb{C}$ is a field
- $(x^2 - 1) = (x-1)(x+1)$ is not prime

### In Matrix Rings

In the ring $M_2(\mathbb{R})$ of $2 \times 2$ matrices:
- There are no prime ideals except the zero ideal
- This is because $M_2(\mathbb{R})$ is a simple ring (has no proper two-sided ideals)

## Connection to Geometry

In algebraic geometry, prime ideals correspond to irreducible algebraic varieties:
- Points correspond to [maximal ideals](def-maximal-ideal.qmd)
- Irreducible curves, surfaces, etc. correspond to prime ideals of various heights
- The Zariski topology on the spectrum of prime ideals provides a bridge between algebra and geometry

## Historical Note

The concept of prime ideals was introduced by Richard Dedekind as a way to restore unique factorization in rings of algebraic integers where ordinary prime factorization fails. This innovation was crucial for the development of algebraic number theory and modern commutative algebra.
