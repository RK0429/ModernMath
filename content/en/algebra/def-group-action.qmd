A **group action** is a way for a group to act on a set by permuting its elements in a manner compatible with the group structure.

## Formal Definition

Let $G$ be a [group](def-group.qmd) and $X$ be a set. A **(left) group action** of $G$ on $X$ is a [function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd)
$$\phi: G \times X \to X$$
written as $\phi(g,x) = g \cdot x$, that satisfies:

1. **Identity axiom**: $e \cdot x = x$ for all $x \in X$, where $e$ is the [identity element](def-identity-element.qmd) of $G$
2. **Compatibility axiom**: $g \cdot (h \cdot x) = (gh) \cdot x$ for all $g, h \in G$ and $x \in X$

## Key Concepts

### Orbit

For any element $x \in X$, the **orbit** of $x$ under $G$ is:
$$G \cdot x = \{g \cdot x : g \in G\}$$

The orbits partition $X$ into disjoint equivalence classes.

### Stabilizer

The **stabilizer** of $x \in X$ is the subgroup:
$$G_x = \{g \in G : g \cdot x = x\}$$

This is indeed a [subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) of $G$.

### Fixed Points

An element $x \in X$ is a **fixed point** if $g \cdot x = x$ for all $g \in G$. Equivalently, $x$ is fixed if its orbit contains only itself.

## Properties

- **Transitive action**: The action is transitive if there is only one orbit, i.e., for any $x, y \in X$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $g \cdot x = y$
- **Faithful action**: The action is faithful if different group elements act differently, i.e., if $g \cdot x = h \cdot x$ for all $x \in X$, then $g = h$
- **Free action**: The action is free if $g \cdot x = x$ for some $x \in X$ implies $g = e$

## Related Concepts

- [Homomorphism](def-homomorphism.qmd): A group action induces a homomorphism $G \to \text{Sym}(X)$
- [Coset](def-coset.qmd): There is a natural bijection between $G/G_x$ and the orbit $G \cdot x$
- [Normal Subgroup](def-normal-subgroup.qmd): The kernel of the induced homomorphism is normal
