# Automorphism {#def-automorphism}

An **automorphism** is an [isomorphism](../category-theory/def-isomorphism.qmd) from a mathematical object to itself. It represents a structure-preserving transformation that maps an object onto itself in a way that can be reversed.

## Formal Definition

For a [Group](def-group.qmd) $(G, \cdot)$, an automorphism is a [homomorphism](def-homomorphism.qmd) $\phi: G \to G$ that is bijective (both injective and surjective).

More generally, in any category, an automorphism of an object $X$ is an isomorphism $f: X \to X$.

## Properties

For any automorphism $\phi$ of a group $G$:

1. **Identity preservation**: $\phi(e) = e$ where $e$ is the [identity element](def-identity-element.qmd)
2. **Inverse preservation**: $\phi(g^{-1}) = \phi(g)^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$
3. **Operation preservation**: $\phi(gh) = \phi(g)\phi(h)$ for all $g, h \in G$
4. **Bijection**: $\phi$ is both one-to-one and onto

## The Automorphism Group

The set of all automorphisms of an object $X$ forms a group under composition, denoted $\text{Aut}(X)$:

- **Closure**: The composition of two automorphisms is an automorphism
- **Identity**: The identity map $\text{id}_X$ is an automorphism
- **Inverses**: Every automorphism has an inverse that is also an automorphism
- **Associativity**: Function composition is associative

## Types of Automorphisms

### Inner Automorphisms

For a group $G$, an **inner automorphism** is defined by conjugation by an element $g \in G$:
$$\phi_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$$

The set of inner automorphisms forms a normal subgroup of $\text{Aut}(G)$, denoted $\text{Inn}(G)$.

### Outer Automorphisms

An **outer automorphism** is an automorphism that is not inner. The quotient group $\text{Out}(G) = \text{Aut}(G)/\text{Inn}(G)$ is called the outer automorphism group.

## Examples

### Groups

1. **Cyclic groups**: For $\mathbb{Z}_n$, we have $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_n) \cong (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$
2. **Symmetric groups**: Every automorphism of $S_n$ is inner for $n \neq 6$
3. **Abelian groups**: For abelian groups, all conjugations are trivial, so $\text{Inn}(G) = \{e\}$

### Fields

1. **Complex numbers**: Complex conjugation $z \mapsto \bar{z}$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{C}$
2. **Field extensions**: The Galois group consists of all automorphisms of a field extension

### Vector Spaces

For a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, $\text{Aut}(V)$ is the general linear group $GL(V)$ of invertible linear transformations.

### Graphs

A graph automorphism is a permutation of vertices that preserves adjacency relations.

## Relationship to Group Actions

The automorphism group $\text{Aut}(X)$ naturally [acts](def-group-action.qmd) on $X$:
- For each $\phi \in \text{Aut}(X)$ and $x \in X$, the action is given by $\phi \cdot x = \phi(x)$
- This action satisfies all group action axioms

## Applications

1. **Galois Theory**: Field automorphisms are fundamental to understanding polynomial equations
2. **Symmetry Analysis**: Automorphisms represent the symmetries of mathematical structures
3. **Classification**: Objects with isomorphic automorphism groups share important structural properties
4. **Cryptography**: Certain cryptographic protocols rely on the difficulty of computing automorphisms

## Complete Groups

A group $G$ is called **complete** if:
- Its center $Z(G)$ is trivial
- Every automorphism of $G$ is inner (i.e., $\text{Aut}(G) = \text{Inn}(G)$)
