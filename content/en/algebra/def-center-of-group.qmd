# Center of a Group {#def-center-of-group}

The **center of a group** is the set of all elements that commute with every element of the group.

## Formal Definition

Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a @def-group. The **center** of $G$, denoted $Z(G)$, is defined as:

$$Z(G) = \{z \in G : zg = gz \text{ for all } g \in G\}$$

The notation $Z(G)$ comes from the German word "Zentrum" meaning center. The elements of $Z(G)$ are called **central elements** of $G$.

## Properties

### Subgroup Structure

The center $Z(G)$ is always a @def-subgroup of $G$:

1. **Non-empty**: The identity element $e \in Z(G)$ since $eg = ge$ for all $g \in G$
2. **Closure**: If $x, y \in Z(G)$, then $(xy)g = x(yg) = x(gy) = (xg)y = (gx)y = g(xy)$ for all $g \in G$
3. **Inverses**: If $x \in Z(G)$, then $gx = xg$ implies $x^{-1}g = gx^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$

### Normal and Abelian

The center has two important structural properties:

1. **Normal Subgroup**: $Z(G)$ is always a @def-normal-subgroup of $G$. For any $g \in G$ and $z \in Z(G)$:
   $$gzg^{-1} = gg^{-1}z = z \in Z(G)$$

2. **Abelian Subgroup**: $Z(G)$ is always an @def-abelian-group since all its elements commute with each other by definition.

### Relationship to Group Structure

1. **Abelian Groups**: A group $G$ is abelian if and only if $Z(G) = G$

2. **Centerless Groups**: A group is called **centerless** if $Z(G) = \{e\}$ (contains only the identity)

3. **Quotient Structure**: The quotient $G/Z(G)$ measures how "non-abelian" $G$ is. If $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ must be abelian

4. **Inner Automorphisms**: There is a homomorphism $\phi: G \to \text{Aut}(G)$ given by $\phi(g)(x) = gxg^{-1}$. The kernel of $\phi$ is exactly $Z(G)$, and its image is the group of inner @def-automorphism, denoted $\text{Inn}(G)$. This gives us:
   $$G/Z(G) \cong \text{Inn}(G)$$

## Examples

### Specific Groups

1. **Abelian Groups**: For any abelian group $G$, we have $Z(G) = G$

2. **Trivial Group**: $Z(\{e\}) = \{e\}$

3. **Symmetric Group**: $Z(S_n) = \{e\}$ for $n \geq 3$

4. **Alternating Group**: $Z(A_n) = \{e\}$ for $n \geq 4$

5. **Dihedral Group**: For the dihedral group $D_n$ of order $2n$:
   - If $n$ is odd: $Z(D_n) = \{e\}$
   - If $n$ is even: $Z(D_n) = \{e, r^{n/2}\}$ where $r$ is the rotation generator

6. **Quaternion Group**: For $Q_8 = \{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\}$, we have $Z(Q_8) = \{1, -1\}$

### Matrix Groups

1. **General Linear Group**: $Z(GL_n(\mathbb{F})) = \{cI_n : c \in \mathbb{F}^*\}$ (scalar matrices)

2. **Special Linear Group**: $Z(SL_n(\mathbb{F})) = \{cI_n : c^n = 1\}$ (scalar matrices with determinant 1)

3. **Orthogonal Group**: $Z(O_n(\mathbb{F})) = \{I_n, -I_n\}$ when the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}$ is not 2

## Applications

The center of a group appears in many important contexts:

1. **Classification**: Non-abelian @def-simple-group are always centerless

2. **Central Extensions**: The center plays a key role in the theory of group extensions and cohomology

3. **Representation Theory**: Central elements act as scalar multiples in irreducible representations

4. **Nilpotent Groups**: A group is nilpotent if and only if its upper central series reaches the whole group
