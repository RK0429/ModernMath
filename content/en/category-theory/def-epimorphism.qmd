# Definition: Epimorphism {#def-epimorphism}

An **epimorphism** (also called an epic morphism or simply epi) is a [morphism](def-morphism.qmd) in a [category](def-category.qmd) that satisfies the right-cancellation property.

## Formal Definition

In a [category](def-category.qmd) $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $f: A \to B$ is an **epimorphism** if for any object $C$ and any pair of morphisms $g, h: B \to C$, the following implication holds:

$$g \circ f = h \circ f \implies g = h$$

In other words, $f$ is right-cancellative: it can be "cancelled" from the right side of an equation.

## Characterization

A morphism $f: A \to B$ is an epimorphism if and only if for every object $C$, the induced function
$$f^*: \text{Hom}(B, C) \to \text{Hom}(A, C)$$
defined by $f^*(g) = g \circ f$ is injective.

## Examples

### In Familiar Categories

1. **Set**: In the category of sets, epimorphisms are exactly the surjective functions
2. **Grp**: In the category of groups, epimorphisms are the surjective group homomorphisms
3. **Top**: In the category of topological spaces, epimorphisms are the continuous maps with dense image
4. **Vect**: In the category of vector spaces over a field, epimorphisms are the surjective linear transformations
5. **Ab**: In the category of abelian groups, epimorphisms are the surjective group homomorphisms

### Non-surjective Epimorphisms

Not all epimorphisms are surjective in the usual sense:

- **Ring**: In the category of rings, the inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ is an epimorphism (as a [ring homomorphism](../algebra/def-ring-homomorphism.qmd)) but not surjective
- **Haus**: In the category of Hausdorff spaces, the inclusion $\mathbb{Q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an epimorphism (dense image) but not surjective
- **Mon**: In the category of [monoids](../algebra/def-monoid.qmd), there exist non-surjective epimorphisms

## Properties

### Basic Properties

1. **Composition**: The [composition](def-composition.qmd) of two epimorphisms is an epimorphism
2. **Identity**: Every identity morphism is an epimorphism
3. **Decomposition**: If $g \circ f$ is an epimorphism, then $g$ is an epimorphism

### Relationship to Other Concepts

1. **Retractions**: Every retraction (right inverse) is an epimorphism
2. **Isomorphisms**: Every [isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd) is both a [monomorphism](def-monomorphism.qmd) and an epimorphism
3. **Coequalizers**: Every coequalizer is an epimorphism

## Types of Epimorphisms

In categories with additional structure, we can define special types of epimorphisms:

1. **Regular epimorphism**: A coequalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms
2. **Strong epimorphism**: An epimorphism that has the right lifting property with respect to monomorphisms
3. **Extremal epimorphism**: An epimorphism that doesn't factor through any proper monomorphism
4. **Split epimorphism**: An epimorphism that has a right inverse (i.e., a retraction)

## Categorical Importance

Epimorphisms are fundamental in category theory because:

1. They generalize the notion of "surjective" to arbitrary categories
2. They are preserved by many categorical constructions (e.g., pushouts)
3. They appear naturally in the study of quotient objects
4. They form one half of the factorization systems in many categories

## Dual Concept

The categorical dual of an epimorphism is a **[monomorphism](def-monomorphism.qmd)**. That is, an epimorphism in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is a monomorphism in the opposite category $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}$.
