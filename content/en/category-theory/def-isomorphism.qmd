An **isomorphism** in a [Category](def-category.qmd) is a [Morphism](def-morphism.qmd) that has a two-sided inverse. Isomorphic objects are considered "the same" from the categorical perspective.

## Formal Definition

A morphism $f: A \to B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an **isomorphism** if there exists a morphism $g: B \to A$ such that:
1. $g \circ f = \text{id}_A$
2. $f \circ g = \text{id}_B$

The morphism $g$ is called the **inverse** of $f$, denoted $f^{-1}$.

## Properties

1. **Uniqueness of Inverse**: If $f$ has an inverse, it is unique
2. **Symmetry**: If $f: A \to B$ is an isomorphism, then $f^{-1}: B \to A$ is also an isomorphism
3. **Composition**: The [Composition](def-composition.qmd) of isomorphisms is an isomorphism:
   - If $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ are isomorphisms
   - Then $g \circ f: A \to C$ is an isomorphism with $(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}$
4. **Mono and Epi**: Every isomorphism is both a [monomorphism](def-monomorphism.qmd) and an [epimorphism](def-epimorphism.qmd)

## Isomorphic Objects

Objects $A$ and $B$ are **isomorphic**, written $A \cong B$, if there exists an isomorphism $f: A \to B$.

Isomorphism is an [equivalence relation](../logic-set-theory/def-equivalence-relation.qmd):
- **Reflexive**: $A \cong A$ via $\text{id}_A$
- **Symmetric**: $A \cong B$ implies $B \cong A$
- **Transitive**: $A \cong B$ and $B \cong C$ implies $A \cong C$

## Examples in Different Categories

### Set
- Isomorphisms are bijective functions
- Two sets are isomorphic iff they have the same [cardinality](../logic-set-theory/def-cardinality.qmd)

### Group
- Isomorphisms are bijective group homomorphisms
- Example: $(\mathbb{Z}, +) \cong (2\mathbb{Z}, +)$ via $n \mapsto 2n$

### Top (Topological Spaces)
- Isomorphisms are [homeomorphisms](../topology/def-homeomorphism.qmd) (continuous bijections with continuous inverse)
- Example: Open interval $(0,1)$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$

### Vect (Vector Spaces)
- Isomorphisms are invertible linear transformations
- Finite-dimensional spaces are isomorphic iff they have the same dimension

## Special Types

### [Automorphism](../algebra/def-automorphism.qmd)
An isomorphism from an object to itself: $f: A \to A$

### Natural Isomorphism
An isomorphism in the functor category (see [Natural Transformation](def-natural-transformation.qmd))

## Categorical Perspective

- Isomorphism captures the idea of "sameness" in a category
- Category theory studies properties invariant under isomorphism
- The principle of equivalence: isomorphic objects are indistinguishable within the category

## Non-Examples

- In **Set**: Injective but non-surjective functions
- In **Group**: Non-bijective homomorphisms
- Continuous functions that aren't homeomorphisms
