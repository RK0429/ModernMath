# Natural Transformation

A **natural transformation** provides a way to transform one [Functor](def-functor.qmd) into another while respecting the internal structure of the categories involved.

## Formal Definition

Let $F, G: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be two functors between categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$. A natural transformation $\eta: F \Rightarrow G$ consists of:

- For each object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, a [Morphism](def-morphism.qmd) $\eta_X: F(X) \to G(X)$ in $\mathcal{D}$

Such that for every morphism $f: X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the following diagram commutes:

```
F(X) --F(f)--> F(Y)
 |              |
η_X            η_Y
 ↓              ↓
G(X) --G(f)--> G(Y)
```

That is, $\eta_Y \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \eta_X$.

## Components and Naturality

- Each morphism $\eta_X$ is called a **component** of the natural transformation
- The commutativity condition is called the **naturality condition**
- When this condition holds, we say that $\eta$ is **natural in X**

## Special Cases

1. **Natural Isomorphism**: A natural transformation where every component $\eta_X$ is an isomorphism
2. **Identity Natural Transformation**: For any functor $F$, the identity transformation $\text{id}_F$ has components $(\text{id}_F)_X = \text{id}_{F(X)}$

## Composition

Natural transformations can be composed:
- **Vertical Composition**: If $\eta: F \Rightarrow G$ and $\mu: G \Rightarrow H$, then $\mu \circ \eta: F \Rightarrow H$
- **Horizontal Composition**: Natural transformations can also be composed with functors
