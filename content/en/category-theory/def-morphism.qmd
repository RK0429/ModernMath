# Morphism

A **morphism** (also called an arrow) is a fundamental concept in [Category](def-category.qmd) theory representing a structure-preserving map between objects. When viewing a category as a [Directed Graph](../combinatorics/def-graph.qmd), morphisms are the directed edges between vertices (objects).

## Formal Definition

In a [Category](def-category.qmd) $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $f: A \to B$ consists of:
- A **domain** (or source) object $A$
- A **codomain** (or target) object $B$
- An abstract "arrow" $f$ from $A$ to $B$

## Key Properties

For morphisms in a category, we have:

1. **Composition**: If $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$, then there exists a composite morphism $g \circ f: A \to C$

2. **Identity**: For each object $A$, there exists an identity morphism $\text{id}_A: A \to A$

3. **Associativity**: $(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$ whenever the compositions are defined

4. **Identity laws**: $f \circ \text{id}_A = f$ and $\text{id}_B \circ f = f$ for $f: A \to B$

## Notation

The collection of all morphisms from $A$ to $B$ in category $\mathcal{C}$ is denoted:
- $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, B)$ or
- $\mathcal{C}(A, B)$ or
- $\text{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(A, B)$

## Types of Morphisms

Special types of morphisms include:
- **[Monomorphism](def-monomorphism.qmd)**: A categorical generalization of injective functions
- **[Epimorphism](def-epimorphism.qmd)**: A categorical generalization of surjective functions
- **[Isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd)**: A morphism with a two-sided inverse
