# Functor {#def-functor}

A **functor** is a structure-preserving mapping between [Category](def-category.qmd) structures. Since categories can be viewed as [Directed Graphs](../combinatorics/def-graph.qmd) with extra structure, functors are essentially graph homomorphisms that also preserve the composition operation.

## Formal Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories. A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ consists of:

1. An **object mapping**: For each object $A \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$, an object $F(A) \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{D})$
2. A **morphism mapping**: For each morphism $f: A \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $F(f): F(A) \to F(B)$ in $\mathcal{D}$

satisfying:

### Functor Laws

1. **Identity preservation**: $F(\text{id}_A) = \text{id}_{F(A)}$ for all objects $A$
2. **Composition preservation**: $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$ for all composable morphisms $f$ and $g$

## Types of Functors

- **Covariant functor**: As defined above
- **Contravariant functor**: Reverses the direction of morphisms
- **Faithful functor**: Injective on morphism sets (preserves [monomorphisms](def-monomorphism.qmd))
- **Full functor**: Surjective on morphism sets
- **Fully faithful functor**: Both faithful and full
- **Essentially surjective**: Every object in $\mathcal{D}$ is isomorphic to $F(A)$ for some $A$

## Examples

- The forgetful functor from **Grp** to **Set**
- The [@free group](../algebra/def-free-group.qmd) functor from **Set** to **Grp**
- The [fundamental group](../topology/def-fundamental-group.qmd) functor from **Top** to **Grp**
