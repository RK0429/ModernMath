# The Category of Sets

The category **Set** is one of the most fundamental examples in [Category](def-category.qmd) theory, with sets as objects and functions as morphisms.

## Definition

The category **Set** consists of:
- **Objects**: All [Set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) s
- **Morphisms**: Functions between sets
- **Composition**: Function composition
- **Identity**: The identity function on each set

## Verification of Category Axioms

We verify that **Set** satisfies the axioms of a category:

### 1. Composition is Associative

For functions $f: A \to B$, $g: B \to C$, and $h: C \to D$:
$$(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$$

This holds because function composition is associative: for any $x \in A$,
$$((h \circ g) \circ f)(x) = h(g(f(x))) = (h \circ (g \circ f))(x)$$

### 2. Identity Laws

For each set $A$, the identity function $\text{id}_A: A \to A$ defined by $\text{id}_A(x) = x$ satisfies:
- For any $f: A \to B$: $f \circ \text{id}_A = f$
- For any $g: B \to A$: $\text{id}_A \circ g = g$

## Properties of Set

1. **Size**: Set is a **large category** - its collection of objects forms a proper class, not a set

2. **Special Morphisms**:
   - [Monomorphisms](def-monomorphism.qmd) in Set are exactly the injective functions
   - [Epimorphisms](def-epimorphism.qmd) in Set are exactly the surjective functions
   - [Isomorphisms](def-isomorphism.qmd) in Set are exactly the bijective functions

3. **Initial and Terminal Objects**:
   - The empty set $\emptyset$ is the initial object (unique function from $\emptyset$ to any set)
   - Any singleton set $\{*\}$ is a terminal object (unique function from any set to $\{*\}$)
