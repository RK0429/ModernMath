# Definition: Monomorphism {#def-monomorphism}

A **monomorphism** (also called a monic morphism or simply mono) is a [morphism](def-morphism.qmd) in a [category](def-category.qmd) that satisfies the left-cancellation property.

## Formal Definition

In a [category](def-category.qmd) $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $f: A \to B$ is a **monomorphism** if for any object $C$ and any pair of morphisms $g, h: C \to A$, the following implication holds:

$$f \circ g = f \circ h \implies g = h$$

In other words, $f$ is left-cancellative: it can be "cancelled" from the left side of an equation.

## Characterization

A morphism $f: A \to B$ is a monomorphism if and only if for every object $C$, the induced function
$$f_*: \text{Hom}(C, A) \to \text{Hom}(C, B)$$
defined by $f_*(g) = f \circ g$ is injective.

## Examples

### In Familiar Categories

1. **Set**: In the category of sets, monomorphisms are exactly the injective functions
2. **Grp**: In the category of groups, monomorphisms are the injective group homomorphisms
3. **Ring**: In the category of rings, monomorphisms are the injective ring homomorphisms
4. **Top**: In the category of topological spaces, monomorphisms are the injective continuous maps
5. **Vect**: In the category of vector spaces, monomorphisms are the injective linear transformations

### Non-injective Monomorphisms

Not all monomorphisms are injective in the usual sense:

- In the category **Div** of divisible abelian groups, the quotient map $q: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is a monomorphism but not injective (every integer maps to 0)
- In certain categories of topological spaces with additional structure, there exist monomorphisms that are not injective as functions

## Properties

### Basic Properties

1. **Composition**: The [composition](def-composition.qmd) of two monomorphisms is a monomorphism
2. **Identity**: Every identity morphism is a monomorphism
3. **Decomposition**: If $g \circ f$ is a monomorphism, then $f$ is a monomorphism

### Relationship to Other Concepts

1. **Sections**: Every section (left inverse) is a monomorphism
2. **Isomorphisms**: Every [isomorphism](def-isomorphism.qmd) is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism
3. **Equalizers**: Every equalizer is a monomorphism

## Types of Monomorphisms

In categories with additional structure, we can define special types of monomorphisms:

1. **Regular monomorphism**: An equalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms
2. **Strong monomorphism**: A monomorphism that has the left lifting property with respect to epimorphisms
3. **Extremal monomorphism**: A monomorphism that doesn't factor through any proper epimorphism
4. **Split monomorphism**: A monomorphism that has a left inverse (i.e., a section)

## Categorical Importance

Monomorphisms are fundamental in category theory because:

1. They generalize the notion of "injective" to arbitrary categories
2. They are preserved by many categorical constructions (e.g., pullbacks)
3. They appear naturally in the study of subobjects
4. They form one half of the factorization systems in many categories

## Dual Concept

The categorical dual of a monomorphism is an **epimorphism**. That is, a monomorphism in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an epimorphism in the opposite category $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}$.
