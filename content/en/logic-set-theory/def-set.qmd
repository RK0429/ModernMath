# Definition: Set {#def-set}

A **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or **members** of the set.

## Notation

- If $a$ is an element of set $A$, we write $a \in A$
- If $a$ is not an element of set $A$, we write $a \notin A$
- Sets are typically denoted by capital letters: $A, B, C, \ldots$
- Elements are typically denoted by lowercase letters: $a, b, c, \ldots$

## Ways to Define Sets

1. **Roster notation**: List all elements between braces
   - Example: $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$

2. **Set-builder notation**: Specify a property that elements must satisfy
   - Example: $B = \{x \in \mathbb{N} : x < 6\}$

## Fundamental Properties

- **Distinctness**: Each element appears only once in a set
- **Orderless**: The order of elements does not matter
  - $\{1, 2, 3\} = \{3, 1, 2\}$
- **Well-defined**: For any object, it must be clear whether it is an element of the set or not

## Special Sets

- **Empty set**: The set with no elements, denoted $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$
- **Singleton**: A set with exactly one element
