# Definition: Function {#def-function}

A **function** from a [set](def-set.qmd) $A$ to a [set](def-set.qmd) $B$ is a relation that assigns to each element of $A$ exactly one element of $B$.

## Formal Definition

A function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ (written $f: A \to B$) is a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$ such that:

1. **Existence**: For every $a \in A$, there exists at least one $b \in B$ such that $(a, b) \in f$
2. **Uniqueness**: For every $a \in A$, if $(a, b_1) \in f$ and $(a, b_2) \in f$, then $b_1 = b_2$

## Notation and Terminology

- **Domain**: The set $A$ is called the domain of $f$, denoted $\text{dom}(f) = A$
- **Codomain**: The set $B$ is called the codomain of $f$
- **Value**: If $(a, b) \in f$, we write $f(a) = b$ and say "$b$ is the value of $f$ at $a$"
- **Image/Range**: The set $\{f(a) : a \in A\} = \{b \in B : \exists a \in A, f(a) = b\}$ is called the image or range of $f$, denoted $\text{im}(f)$ or $\text{range}(f)$

## Types of Functions

### Injective (One-to-One)

A function $f: A \to B$ is **injective** if different elements in $A$ map to different elements in $B$:

$$\forall a_1, a_2 \in A: f(a_1) = f(a_2) \implies a_1 = a_2$$

### Surjective (Onto)

A function $f: A \to B$ is **surjective** if every element in $B$ is the image of at least one element in $A$:

$$\forall b \in B: \exists a \in A \text{ such that } f(a) = b$$

Equivalently, $f$ is surjective if $\text{im}(f) = B$.

### Bijective (One-to-One Correspondence)

A function $f: A \to B$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective. A bijective function has an inverse function $f^{-1}: B \to A$.

## Special Functions

- **Identity function**: $\text{id}_A: A \to A$ defined by $\text{id}_A(a) = a$ for all $a \in A$
- **Constant function**: A function $f: A \to B$ where $f(a) = b_0$ for some fixed $b_0 \in B$ and all $a \in A$
- **Inclusion function**: If $A \subseteq B$, the inclusion $i: A \to B$ defined by $i(a) = a$ for all $a \in A$

## Properties

- **Composition**: If $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$, then $g \circ f: A \to C$ is defined by $(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a))$
- **Equality**: Two functions $f, g: A \to B$ are equal if $f(a) = g(a)$ for all $a \in A$
