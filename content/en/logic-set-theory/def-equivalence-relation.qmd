# Equivalence Relation {#def-equivalence-relation}

An **equivalence relation** on a [set](def-set.qmd) $A$ is a [relation](def-relation.qmd) $\sim$ on $A$ that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

## Formal Definition

A relation $\sim$ on a set $A$ is an equivalence relation if and only if it satisfies the following three properties:

### 1. Reflexive Property

For all $a \in A$:
$$a \sim a$$

Every element is related to itself.

### 2. Symmetric Property

For all $a, b \in A$:
$$a \sim b \implies b \sim a$$

If $a$ is related to $b$, then $b$ is related to $a$.

### 3. Transitive Property

For all $a, b, c \in A$:
$$(a \sim b \text{ and } b \sim c) \implies a \sim c$$

If $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $c$, then $a$ is related to $c$.

## Equivalence Classes

Given an equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set $A$, for each element $a \in A$, the **equivalence class** of $a$ is:

$$[a] = \{x \in A : x \sim a\}$$

### Properties of Equivalence Classes

1. **Non-empty**: $a \in [a]$ for all $a \in A$ (by reflexivity)
2. **Equal or disjoint**: For any $a, b \in A$, either $[a] = [b]$ or $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$
3. **Partition**: The set of all equivalence classes forms a partition of $A$:
   $$A = \bigcup_{a \in A} [a]$$

## Quotient Set

The **quotient set** of $A$ by $\sim$, denoted $A/\sim$, is the set of all equivalence classes:

$$A/\sim = \{[a] : a \in A\}$$

## Examples

### 1. Equality

The relation $=$ on any set is an equivalence relation:
- Reflexive: $a = a$
- Symmetric: $a = b \implies b = a$
- Transitive: $a = b$ and $b = c \implies a = c$

### 2. Congruence Modulo n

For a fixed positive integer $n$, the relation $\equiv_n$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined by:
$$a \equiv_n b \iff n \mid (a - b)$$

is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are the residue classes modulo $n$.

### 3. Similar Matrices

On the set of $n \times n$ matrices, the relation "is similar to" defined by:
$$A \sim B \iff \exists \text{ invertible } P \text{ such that } B = P^{-1}AP$$

is an equivalence relation.

### 4. Parallel Lines

On the set of lines in a plane, the relation "is parallel to" is an equivalence relation (where we consider a line parallel to itself).

## Important Theorems

### Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations

There is a bijective correspondence between:
1. Equivalence relations on a set $A$
2. Partitions of the set $A$

Every equivalence relation induces a partition, and every partition defines an equivalence relation.

## Applications

- **Modular arithmetic**: Congruence classes form the foundation of modular arithmetic
- **Abstract algebra**: Quotient groups, quotient rings, and quotient spaces
- **Topology**: Quotient topologies and identification spaces
- **Computer science**: Union-find data structures, type equivalence
