# Partial Order {#def-partial-order}

A **partial order** on a [set](def-set.qmd) $A$ is a [relation](def-relation.qmd) $\leq$ on $A$ that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

## Formal Definition

A relation $\leq$ on a set $A$ is a partial order if and only if it satisfies the following three properties:

### 1. Reflexive Property

For all $a \in A$:
$$a \leq a$$

Every element is related to itself.

### 2. Antisymmetric Property

For all $a, b \in A$:
$$(a \leq b \text{ and } b \leq a) \implies a = b$$

If $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $a$, then $a$ and $b$ must be equal.

### 3. Transitive Property

For all $a, b, c \in A$:
$$(a \leq b \text{ and } b \leq c) \implies a \leq c$$

If $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $c$, then $a$ is related to $c$.

## Partially Ordered Set (Poset)

A **partially ordered set** (or **poset**) is an ordered pair $(A, \leq)$ consisting of a set $A$ together with a partial order relation $\leq$ on $A$.

### Notation

- We often write $a < b$ to mean $a \leq b$ and $a \neq b$ (strict partial order)
- If neither $a \leq b$ nor $b \leq a$, we say $a$ and $b$ are **incomparable**
- We write $a \parallel b$ when $a$ and $b$ are incomparable

## Comparable Elements

Two elements $a, b \in A$ are **comparable** if either $a \leq b$ or $b \leq a$ (or both). The word "partial" in partial order indicates that not all pairs of elements need to be comparable.

## Examples

### 1. Subset Relation

The [subset](def-subset.qmd) relation $\subseteq$ on the [power set](def-power-set.qmd) $\mathcal{P}(X)$ of any set $X$ is a partial order:
- Reflexive: $A \subseteq A$ for all $A \in \mathcal{P}(X)$
- Antisymmetric: $(A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \subseteq A) \implies A = B$
- Transitive: $(A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \subseteq C) \implies A \subseteq C$

### 2. Divisibility Relation

On the positive integers $\mathbb{Z}^+$, the relation $a \mid b$ (read "$a$ divides $b$") is a partial order:
- Reflexive: $a \mid a$ for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}^+$
- Antisymmetric: $(a \mid b \text{ and } b \mid a) \implies a = b$ for positive integers
- Transitive: $(a \mid b \text{ and } b \mid c) \implies a \mid c$

### 3. Standard Order on Real Numbers

The usual $\leq$ relation on $\mathbb{R}$ is a partial order (in fact, a total order):
- Reflexive: $a \leq a$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$
- Antisymmetric: $(a \leq b \text{ and } b \leq a) \implies a = b$
- Transitive: $(a \leq b \text{ and } b \leq c) \implies a \leq c$

### 4. Component-wise Order

On $\mathbb{R}^n$, define $(x_1, ..., x_n) \leq (y_1, ..., y_n)$ if $x_i \leq y_i$ for all $i$. This is a partial order where many pairs are incomparable.

## Special Elements

In a poset $(A, \leq)$:

### Minimal and Maximal Elements

- $a \in A$ is **minimal** if there is no $b \in A$ with $b < a$
- $a \in A$ is **maximal** if there is no $b \in A$ with $a < b$

### Least and Greatest Elements

- $a \in A$ is the **least element** (or **minimum**) if $a \leq b$ for all $b \in A$
- $a \in A$ is the **greatest element** (or **maximum**) if $b \leq a$ for all $b \in A$

### Upper and Lower Bounds

For a subset $S \subseteq A$:
- $a \in A$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \leq a$ for all $s \in S$
- $a \in A$ is a **lower bound** of $S$ if $a \leq s$ for all $s \in S$

## Hasse Diagrams

A finite poset can be visualized using a **Hasse diagram**, which:
- Represents elements as vertices
- Draws an edge from $a$ up to $b$ if $a < b$ and there is no $c$ with $a < c < b$
- Omits self-loops and edges implied by transitivity

## Special Types of Partial Orders

### Total Order (Linear Order)

A partial order $\leq$ on $A$ is a **total order** if every two elements are comparable:
$$\forall a, b \in A: (a \leq b \text{ or } b \leq a)$$

### Well Order

A total order on $A$ is a **well order** if every non-empty subset of $A$ has a least element.

### Lattice

A poset $(A, \leq)$ is a **lattice** if every pair of elements has both a least upper bound (join) and a greatest lower bound (meet).

## Important Theorems

### Duality Principle

If $\leq$ is a partial order on $A$, then the **dual relation** $\geq$ defined by:
$$a \geq b \iff b \leq a$$
is also a partial order on $A$.

### Chain and Antichain

- A **chain** in a poset is a subset where all elements are pairwise comparable
- An **antichain** is a subset where no two distinct elements are comparable

## Applications

- **Computer Science**: Dependency resolution, task scheduling, type hierarchies
- **Mathematics**: Order theory, lattice theory, domain theory
- **Logic**: Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras
- **Combinatorics**: Sperner's theorem, Dilworth's theorem
