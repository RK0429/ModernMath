# Pigeonhole Principle

The **Pigeonhole Principle** is a fundamental counting principle stating that if you distribute more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.

## Statement

**Basic Form**: If $n$ items are placed into $k$ containers where $n > k$, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

**General Form**: If $n$ items are placed into $k$ containers, then at least one container must contain at least $\lceil n/k \rceil$ items.

## Formal Statement

Let $f: A \to B$ be a [function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) where $A$ and $B$ are finite [Set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd)s with [cardinalities](../logic-set-theory/def-cardinality.qmd) satisfying $|A| > |B|$. Then $f$ is not injective; that is, there exist distinct elements $a_1, a_2 \in A$ such that $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$.

## Proof

By contradiction. Suppose $f$ is injective. Then each element of $A$ maps to a distinct element of $B$, implying $|A| \leq |B|$. This contradicts our assumption that $|A| > |B|$.

## Generalizations

1. **Infinite Version**: An infinite set cannot be mapped injectively into a finite set.

2. **Probabilistic Version**: If items are distributed randomly, the expected number of items in each container provides bounds on the maximum load.

3. **Multidimensional Version**: Extends to partitioning higher-dimensional spaces.

## Applications

1. **Existence Proofs**: Often used to prove that certain configurations must exist
2. **Computer Science**: Hash table collision analysis, load balancing
3. **Number Theory**: Proving properties about integer sequences
4. **Graph Theory**: Showing certain substructures must exist in large graphs

## Classic Examples

- In any group of 13 people, at least two must have birthdays in the same month
- Among any 6 people, either 3 are mutual friends or 3 are mutual strangers
- In any sequence of $n^2 + 1$ distinct real numbers, there is either an increasing subsequence or a decreasing subsequence of length $n + 1$
