# Example: Polynomial Continuity {#ex-polynomial-continuity}

Polynomial functions from the [polynomial ring](../algebra/def-polynomial-ring.qmd) $\mathbb{R}[x]$ are [continuous](def-continuity.qmd) everywhere on $\mathbb{R}$, providing fundamental examples of continuous functions.

## Statement

Every polynomial function $p: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by:
$$p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$$
where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$, is continuous at every point $c \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Proof Strategy

We build up from simple cases:

1. **Constant function**: $f(x) = a_0$ is continuous
   - For any $\varepsilon > 0$, choose any $\delta > 0$
   - Then $|f(x) - f(c)| = |a_0 - a_0| = 0 < \varepsilon$

2. **Identity function**: $f(x) = x$ is continuous
   - For any $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $\delta = \varepsilon$
   - If $|x - c| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(c)| = |x - c| < \delta = \varepsilon$

3. **Products and sums**: Using the arithmetic properties of continuous functions:
   - If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $c$, then $f + g$ and $f \cdot g$ are continuous at $c$
   - By induction, $x^n$ is continuous for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$
   - Therefore, $a_i x^i$ is continuous for each term
   - The sum $p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ is continuous

## Specific Example

Consider $p(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1$. To verify continuity at $c = 1$:
- $p(1) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$
- For sequences $x_n \to 1$: $p(x_n) = x_n^3 - 2x_n + 1 \to 1^3 - 2(1) + 1 = 0 = p(1)$

## Importance

Polynomial continuity is crucial because:
- Polynomials approximate other functions (Taylor [series](def-series.qmd))
- They form a dense subset of continuous functions (Weierstrass approximation)
- They provide concrete examples for testing theorems about continuity
