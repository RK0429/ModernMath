The **Mean Value Theorem (MVT)** states that for a differentiable function on an interval, there exists at least one point where the instantaneous rate of change equals the average rate of change over the interval.

## Statement

If $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies:
1. $f$ is [continuous](def-continuity.qmd) on the closed interval $[a,b]$
2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$

Then there exists at least one $c \in (a,b)$ such that:
$$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

## Geometric Interpretation

The theorem guarantees that somewhere between $a$ and $b$, the tangent line to the curve is parallel to the secant line connecting $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.

## Special Cases

### Rolle's Theorem
If additionally $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

This is MVT with horizontal secant line.

### Cauchy Mean Value Theorem
For functions $f, g$ both continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, with $g'(x) \neq 0$ on $(a,b)$:

There exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that:
$$\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)}$$

## Proof Sketch

1. Define auxiliary function: $h(x) = f(x) - f(a) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x - a)$
2. Note that $h(a) = h(b) = 0$
3. Apply Rolle's theorem to $h$
4. Find $c$ where $h'(c) = 0$, which gives the result

## Consequences

1. **Monotonicity**: If $f' > 0$ on $(a,b)$, then $f$ is strictly increasing
2. **Constant functions**: If $f' = 0$ on $(a,b)$, then $f$ is constant
3. **Lipschitz continuity**: If $|f'| \leq M$ on $(a,b)$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq M|x - y|$

## Applications

### L'Hôpital's Rule
Used in the proof for evaluating limits of indeterminate forms

### Taylor's Theorem
MVT generalizes to higher derivatives, leading to Taylor approximations

### Numerical Analysis
- Error bounds for numerical differentiation
- Convergence analysis of iterative methods

## Examples

1. **Verify MVT**: For $f(x) = x^2$ on $[0,2]$:
   - Average slope: $\frac{4-0}{2-0} = 2$
   - $f'(x) = 2x$, so $f'(c) = 2$ gives $c = 1 \in (0,2)$ ✓

2. **Application**: Prove that $|\sin x - \sin y| \leq |x - y|$:
   - By MVT: $\sin x - \sin y = \cos c \cdot (x - y)$ for some $c$
   - Since $|\cos c| \leq 1$, the result follows
