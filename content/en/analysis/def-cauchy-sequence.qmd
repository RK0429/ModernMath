A **Cauchy sequence** is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses. This concept captures the idea of convergence without requiring knowledge of the limit.

## Formal Definition

Let $(X, d)$ be a [Metric Space](../geometry/def-metric-space.qmd). A [Sequence](def-sequence.qmd) $(x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $X$ is called a **Cauchy sequence** if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m, n \geq N$:

$$d(x_m, x_n) < \varepsilon$$

In symbols: $\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall m,n \geq N: d(x_m, x_n) < \varepsilon$

## Intuition

A Cauchy sequence is one where the terms eventually cluster together. Unlike the definition of [Convergence](def-convergence.qmd), which requires a specific limit point, the Cauchy condition only requires that sequence elements get close to each other.

## Properties

### Fundamental Properties

1. **Every convergent sequence is Cauchy**: If $(x_n) \to x$ in a metric space, then $(x_n)$ is Cauchy.

2. **Cauchy sequences are bounded**: Every Cauchy sequence in a metric space is bounded.

3. **Subsequence property**: If a Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence, then the entire sequence converges to the same limit.

### Relationship to Completeness

The importance of Cauchy sequences lies in their connection to [Complete Metric Spaces](def-complete-metric-space.qmd):

- A metric space is complete if and only if every Cauchy sequence converges
- In complete spaces, being Cauchy is equivalent to being convergent

## Examples

### Convergent Cauchy Sequences

1. **In $\mathbb{R}$**: The sequence $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$ is Cauchy.
   - For $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $N > \frac{2}{\varepsilon}$
   - Then for $m, n \geq N$: $|a_m - a_n| = |\frac{1}{m} - \frac{1}{n}| < \frac{1}{N} + \frac{1}{N} < \varepsilon$

2. **Geometric sequence**: $a_n = \frac{1}{2^n}$ is Cauchy in $\mathbb{R}$.
   - Converges to 0

### Non-convergent Cauchy Sequences

1. **In $\mathbb{Q}$**: The sequence of decimal approximations to $\sqrt{2}$:
   - $a_1 = 1.4$
   - $a_2 = 1.41$
   - $a_3 = 1.414$
   - ...

   This is Cauchy in $\mathbb{Q}$ but doesn't converge in $\mathbb{Q}$ (since $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$).

2. **In $(0,1)$**: The sequence $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$ is Cauchy but doesn't converge in $(0,1)$ (the limit 0 is not in the space).

## Cauchy Criterion

The **Cauchy criterion** states that in a complete metric space, a sequence converges if and only if it is Cauchy. This provides a way to prove convergence without knowing the limit.

### Applications

1. **Testing convergence**: We can prove a sequence converges by showing it's Cauchy
2. **Numerical analysis**: Algorithms often generate Cauchy sequences to approximate solutions
3. **Construction of $\mathbb{R}$**: The real numbers can be constructed as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers
