The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** is the central theorem of calculus that establishes the profound connection between differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another.

## Statement

The theorem consists of two closely related parts:

### Part I (First Fundamental Theorem)

Let $f$ be a [continuous](def-continuity.qmd) function on $[a,b]$. Define the function $F$ on $[a,b]$ by:

$$F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt$$

Then $F$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$, and:
$$F'(x) = f(x)$$

for all $x \in (a,b)$.

### Part II (Second Fundamental Theorem)

Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$. If $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$ on $[a,b]$ (i.e., $F' = f$), then:

$$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

## Interpretation

### Part I Interpretation
Part I tells us that every continuous function has an antiderivative, namely the [integral](def-integral.qmd) function with variable upper limit. It also shows that differentiation undoes integration.

### Part II Interpretation
Part II provides a powerful method for evaluating definite integrals: instead of computing [limits](def-limit.qmd) of Riemann sums, we can find an antiderivative and evaluate it at the endpoints.

## Proof Sketch

### Proof of Part I

Let $h > 0$ be small. By the definition of [derivative](def-derivative.qmd):

$$F'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h} \int_x^{x+h} f(t) \, dt$$

By the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, there exists $c \in [x, x+h]$ such that:

$$\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \, dt = f(c) \cdot h$$

Therefore:
$$F'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} f(c)$$

Since $c \to x$ as $h \to 0$ and $f$ is continuous, we get $F'(x) = f(x)$.

### Proof of Part II

Let $G(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt$ and let $F$ be any antiderivative of $f$.

By Part I, $G'(x) = f(x) = F'(x)$, so $(F - G)'(x) = 0$ on $(a,b)$.

Therefore, $F - G$ is constant, say $F(x) - G(x) = C$.

Since $G(a) = 0$, we have $C = F(a)$.

Thus: $F(x) - \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = F(a)$

Setting $x = b$: $F(b) - \int_a^b f(t) \, dt = F(a)$

Therefore: $\int_a^b f(t) \, dt = F(b) - F(a)$

## Historical Development

The theorem was developed independently by:
- **Isaac Newton** (1642-1727): Focused on the relationship between velocities and distances
- **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (1646-1716): Developed the notation and formal framework
- **Isaac Barrow** (1630-1677): Newton's teacher, proved a geometric version
- **James Gregory** (1638-1675): Published an early version with geometric focus

## Consequences and Applications

### 1. Evaluation of Definite Integrals
Instead of computing limits of Riemann sums, we can use:
$$\int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx = [-\cos x]_0^{\pi} = -\cos(\pi) + \cos(0) = 2$$

### 2. Existence of Antiderivatives
Every continuous function on an interval has an antiderivative.

### 3. Integration by Parts
Derived from the product rule and FTC:
$$\int_a^b u \, dv = [uv]_a^b - \int_a^b v \, du$$

### 4. Change of Variables
The substitution rule follows from the chain rule and FTC:
$$\int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) \, du$$

### 5. Physical Applications
- **Kinematics**: Position is the integral of velocity
- **Work**: Work is the integral of force over distance
- **Probability**: Cumulative [distribution](../probability-statistics/def-probability-distribution.qmd) functions are integrals of density functions

## Relationship to Other Theorems

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is closely related to:
- [Mean Value Theorem](thm-mean-value.qmd): Used in the proof of Part I
- [Chain Rule](thm-chain-rule.qmd): Generalizes to composition of functions
- [Taylor Series](thm-taylor-series.qmd): Higher-order version using repeated integration

## Examples

### Example 1: Area Calculation
Find the area under $f(x) = x^2$ from 0 to 2:
$$\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2 = \frac{8}{3} - 0 = \frac{8}{3}$$

### Example 2: Variable Upper Limit
If $F(x) = \int_1^x \frac{1}{t} \, dt$, then by Part I:
$$F'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$$

This shows that $\ln x$ is an antiderivative of $1/x$.

### Example 3: Physics Application
A particle moves with velocity $v(t) = 3t^2 - 2t$. The displacement from $t = 0$ to $t = 3$ is:
$$s = \int_0^3 (3t^2 - 2t) \, dt = [t^3 - t^2]_0^3 = 27 - 9 = 18$$

## Generalizations

1. **Lebesgue Integration**: The theorem extends to more general integration theories
2. **Vector-Valued Functions**: Applies component-wise to vector functions
3. **Complex Analysis**: Cauchy's theorem is an analog for complex functions
4. **Differential Forms**: Stokes' theorem generalizes FTC to higher dimensions
