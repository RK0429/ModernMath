# Definition: Open Ball {#def-open-ball}

Let $(M, d)$ be a [metric space](def-metric-space.qmd). Let $a \in M$ be a point and let $r > 0$ be a positive real number. The **open ball** (or **open metric ball**) of radius $r$ centered at $a$ is the [set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd):

$$B_r(a) = \{x \in M : d(x, a) < r\}$$

## Alternative Notations

The open ball is also commonly denoted as:
- $B(a, r)$ or $B(a; r)$
- $B^o_r(a)$ to emphasize that it is open
- $N_r(a)$ when viewed as a neighborhood

## Key Properties

1. **Center inclusion**: The center $a$ is always in $B_r(a)$ since $d(a, a) = 0 < r$ for any $r > 0$

2. **Open sets**: Every open ball is an open set in the metric topology

3. **Basis for topology**: The collection of all open balls forms a basis for the metric topology on $M$

4. **Nested balls**: If $0 < r_1 < r_2$, then $B_{r_1}(a) \subseteq B_{r_2}(a)$

## Examples

### Euclidean Space
In $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard Euclidean metric:
- In $\mathbb{R}$: $B_r(a) = (a - r, a + r)$ is an open interval
- In $\mathbb{R}^2$: $B_r(a)$ is an open disk (interior of a circle)
- In $\mathbb{R}^3$: $B_r(a)$ is an open sphere (interior of a sphere)

### Other Metrics
The shape of open balls depends on the metric:
- **Taxicab metric** on $\mathbb{R}^2$: Open balls are open diamonds (rotated squares)
- **Maximum metric** on $\mathbb{R}^2$: Open balls are open squares
- **Discrete metric**: $B_r(a) = \{a\}$ if $r \leq 1$, and $B_r(a) = M$ if $r > 1$

## Relationship to Other Concepts

### Closed Ball
The **closed ball** of radius $r$ centered at $a$ is defined as:
$$\overline{B}_r(a) = \{x \in M : d(x, a) \leq r\}$$

Note that $B_r(a) \subseteq \overline{B}_r(a)$, but equality does not always hold.

### Neighborhoods
In a metric space, a set $U$ is a neighborhood of a point $a$ if and only if there exists an $r > 0$ such that $B_r(a) \subseteq U$.

### Continuity
A function $f: (M_1, d_1) \to (M_2, d_2)$ between metric spaces is [continuous](def-continuity.qmd) at $a \in M_1$ if and only if:
For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $f(B_\delta(a)) \subseteq B_\varepsilon(f(a))$.

### Open Sets
A subset $U$ of a metric space $M$ is open if and only if for every $x \in U$, there exists $r > 0$ such that $B_r(x) \subseteq U$.

## Important Results

1. **Union of open balls**: Every open set in a metric space is a union of open balls

2. **Metric topology**: The topology induced by a metric has the open balls as a basis

3. **Separation property**: In a metric space, for distinct points $x \neq y$, there exist disjoint open balls $B_{r_1}(x)$ and $B_{r_2}(y)$
