# Limit of a Sequence {#def-limit}

Let $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of real numbers. We say that the sequence **converges** to a limit $L \in \mathbb{R}$ if:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n > N$:
$$|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$$

## Notation

We write this as:
- $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L$
- $a_n \to L$ as $n \to \infty$
- $(a_n) \to L$

## Formal Definition

Using logical symbols:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L \iff \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n > N : |a_n - L| < \varepsilon$$

## Geometric Interpretation

The definition means that eventually all terms of the sequence lie within any given distance $\varepsilon$ from $L$. No matter how small we make $\varepsilon$, we can find a point in the sequence after which all terms are within this distance from $L$.

## Uniqueness

If a sequence converges, its limit is unique. If $a_n \to L_1$ and $a_n \to L_2$, then $L_1 = L_2$.

## Divergence

A sequence that does not converge to any limit is said to **diverge**. This includes:
- Sequences that oscillate (e.g., $(-1)^n$)
- Sequences that grow without bound (e.g., $n$)

The concept of limit is fundamental to analysis and forms the foundation for continuity, derivatives, and integrals.
