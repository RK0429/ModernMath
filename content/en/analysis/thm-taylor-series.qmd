# Taylor Series {#thm-taylor-series}

Taylor series provides a representation of an infinitely differentiable function as an infinite [series](def-series.qmd) calculated from the values of the function's [derivatives](def-derivative.qmd) at a single point.

## Statement

Let $f: (a - r, a + r) \to \mathbb{R}$ be infinitely differentiable at $a$. The Taylor series of $f$ at $a$ is:

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n$$

where $f^{(n)}(a)$ denotes the $n$-th derivative of $f$ evaluated at $a$.

## Expanded Form

The Taylor series can be written explicitly as:

$$f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \cdots$$

## Maclaurin Series

When $a = 0$, the Taylor series is called a Maclaurin series:

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 + \cdots$$

## Taylor's Theorem with Remainder

For any $n \geq 0$, if $f$ is $(n+1)$ times differentiable on $(a - r, a + r)$, then:

$$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k + R_n(x)$$

where $R_n(x)$ is the remainder term. By the [mean value theorem](thm-mean-value.qmd), there exists $c$ between $a$ and $x$ such that:

$$R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x - a)^{n+1}$$ (Lagrange form)

## Convergence Properties

### Radius of Convergence

Every Taylor series has a radius of convergence $R \geq 0$ such that:

1. The series [converges](def-convergence.qmd) absolutely for $|x - a| < R$
2. The series diverges for $|x - a| > R$
3. Convergence at $|x - a| = R$ depends on the specific function

The radius can be computed using:
$$\frac{1}{R} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}$$

where $a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}$.

### Analytic Functions

A function $f$ is **analytic** at $a$ if it equals its Taylor series in some neighborhood of $a$ (i.e., in some [open ball](def-open-ball.qmd) centered at $a$). Not all infinitely differentiable functions are analytic.

## Common Taylor Series

1. **Exponential function**: $e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}$ (converges for all $x$)

2. **Sine function**: $\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$ (converges for all $x$)

3. **Cosine function**: $\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!}$ (converges for all $x$)

4. **Natural logarithm**: $\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n}$ (converges for $|x| < 1$)

5. **Geometric series**: $\frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n$ (converges for $|x| < 1$)

## Applications

Taylor series are fundamental for:

- Approximating functions near a point
- Computing limits and derivatives
- Solving differential equations
- Numerical analysis and computation
- Studying function behavior and [continuity](def-continuity.qmd)
- Inspiring [generating functions](../combinatorics/def-generating-function.qmd) in combinatorics

## Example: Computing $e$

Using the Maclaurin series for $e^x$ with $x = 1$:

$$e = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} + \cdots$$

The first few terms give: $e \approx 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.167 + 0.042 = 2.709$

## Warning: Non-Analytic Functions

The function $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \neq 0$ and $f(0) = 0$ is infinitely differentiable everywhere, but its Taylor series at $x = 0$ is identically zero, while the function is non-zero for $x \neq 0$.
