# Metric Space {#def-metric-space}

A **metric space** is a [Set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) $X$ together with a [function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ called a **metric** or **distance function** that satisfies the following axioms for all $x, y, z \in X$:

## Metric Axioms

1. **Non-negativity**: $d(x, y) \geq 0$
2. **Identity of indiscernibles**: $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$
3. **Symmetry**: $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
4. **Triangle inequality**: $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$

## Notation

A metric space is denoted as the ordered pair $(X, d)$ where:
- $X$ is the underlying set
- $d$ is the metric on $X$

## Important Concepts

Given a metric space $(X, d)$:

- **[Open ball](def-open-ball.qmd)**: For $x \in X$ and $r > 0$, the open ball centered at $x$ with radius $r$ is $B(x, r) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) < r\}$
- **Closed ball**: $\overline{B}(x, r) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) \leq r\}$
- **Bounded set**: A subset $A \subseteq X$ is bounded if there exists $x \in X$ and $r > 0$ such that $A \subseteq B(x, r)$

## Relationship to Topology

Every metric space $(X, d)$ induces a topology on $X$ where the open sets are those sets that can be expressed as unions of [open balls](def-open-ball.qmd). This makes every metric space a [Topological Space](../topology/def-topological-space.qmd).
