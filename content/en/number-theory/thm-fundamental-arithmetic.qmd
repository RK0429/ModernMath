# Theorem: Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic {#thm-fundamental-arithmetic}

Every natural number greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of [Prime Number](def-prime.qmd) numbers, up to the order of factors.

## Statement

For every natural number $n > 1$, there exist unique prime numbers $p_1 < p_2 < \cdots < p_k$ and positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ such that:
$$n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k}$$

This representation is called the **prime factorization** of $n$.

## Two Parts

The theorem consists of two claims:

1. **Existence**: Every $n > 1$ has at least one prime factorization
2. **Uniqueness**: The prime factorization is unique (up to ordering)

## Proof Outline

**Existence** (by strong induction):
- Base case: $n = 2$ is prime, so $n = 2^1$
- Inductive step: If $n$ is prime, we're done. Otherwise, $n = ab$ where $1 < a, b < n$
- By induction hypothesis, both $a$ and $b$ have prime factorizations
- Combining these gives a prime factorization of $n$

**Uniqueness** (by contradiction):
- Suppose $n$ has two different prime factorizations
- Using the prime property (if $p \mid ab$, then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$)
- Show that every prime in one factorization must appear in the other
- The exponents must also match

## Examples

- $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1$
- $30 = 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1$
- $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$
- $17 = 17^1$ (prime numbers have trivial factorization)

## Applications

The fundamental theorem enables:
- Greatest common divisor (GCD) calculations (see @def-gcd)
- Least common multiple (LCM) calculations (see @def-lcm)
- Rational number arithmetic
- Many results in algebraic number theory

This theorem justifies calling primes the "building blocks" of the natural numbers.
