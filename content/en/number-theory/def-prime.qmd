# Prime Number {#def-prime}

A natural number $p > 1$ is called a **prime number** (or simply a **prime**) if its only positive divisors are 1 and $p$ itself.

## Formal Definition

A natural number $p > 1$ is prime if and only if:
$$\forall a \in \mathbb{N}, \quad a \mid p \implies a = 1 \text{ or } a = p$$

where $a \mid p$ means "$a$ [divides](def-divisibility.qmd) $p$" (i.e., there exists $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $p = ak$).

## Equivalent Characterizations

1. $p$ has exactly two positive divisors
2. $p$ cannot be written as a product of two natural numbers both greater than 1
3. If $p \mid ab$ for integers $a, b$, then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$ (prime property)

## Examples and Non-Examples

**Prime numbers**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...

**Composite numbers** (non-prime numbers > 1): 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, ...

Note:
- 2 is the only even prime number
- 1 is not considered prime (by modern convention)

## Importance

Prime numbers are the "atoms" of number theory:
- There are infinitely many primes ([Euclid's Theorem](thm-euclid-infinitude-primes.qmd))
- Every natural number > 1 can be uniquely factored into primes (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)
- They appear in numerous areas of mathematics and applications (cryptography, coding theory)
- Their distribution remains a central mystery (Riemann Hypothesis)

## Related Concepts

- **Composite number**: A natural number > 1 that is not prime
- **Coprime**: Two integers are coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1
- **Prime factorization**: Expression of a number as a product of prime powers
- **Prime ideals**: In ring theory, [prime ideals](../algebra/def-prime-ideal.qmd) generalize the concept of prime numbers to arbitrary rings
