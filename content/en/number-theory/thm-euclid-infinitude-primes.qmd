# Euclid's Theorem on the Infinitude of Primes {#thm-euclid-infinitude-primes}

There are infinitely many [prime numbers](def-prime.qmd).

## Statement

For any finite list of prime numbers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, there exists a prime number not in this list. Therefore, the set of prime numbers is infinite.

## Historical Note

Euclid's original formulation (circa 300 BCE) was: "Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers." The ancient Greeks did not have our modern concept of infinity, so Euclid could not have written "there are infinitely many primes."

## Proof

**Euclid's Original Proof:**

Let $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ be any finite list of prime numbers. Consider the number:
$$P = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n + 1$$

Now we consider two cases:

**Case 1:** $P$ is prime.
Then $P$ is a prime number that is not in our original list (since $P > p_i$ for all $i$).

**Case 2:** $P$ is composite.
By the [Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic](thm-fundamental-arithmetic.qmd), $P$ has a prime divisor, say $p$. We claim that $p$ cannot be any of $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.

If $p = p_i$ for some $i$, then $p_i$ [divides](def-divisibility.qmd) both $P$ and $p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n$. Therefore, $p_i$ would divide their difference:
$$P - p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n = 1$$

But no prime divides 1, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, $p$ is a prime not in our original list.

In both cases, we have found a prime not in the original list, proving that any finite list of primes is incomplete.

## Common Misconception

It is often mistakenly thought that Euclid's proof shows that $P = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n + 1$ is always prime. This is false. For example:
- $2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$ (prime)
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 31$ (prime)
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 + 1 = 211$ (prime)
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 + 1 = 2311$ (prime)
- $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 + 1 = 30031 = 59 \times 509$ (composite)

The proof only requires that $P$ has a prime divisor not in the original list.

## Alternative Proofs

**Factorial Proof:**

For any positive integer $n$, consider $n! + 1$. This number is not divisible by any integer from 2 to $n$ (it leaves remainder 1 when divided by each). Therefore, $n! + 1$ is either:
- Prime (and greater than $n$), or
- Divisible by a prime greater than $n$

Either way, for every $n$, there exists a prime greater than $n$, proving infinitude.

## Significance

Euclid's theorem is one of the most elegant proofs in mathematics and has inspired numerous variations:
- Over 200 different proofs have been discovered
- It exemplifies the power of proof by contradiction
- It motivates deeper questions about prime distribution (Prime Number Theorem, Riemann Hypothesis)
- The construction $p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n + 1$ appears in various areas of number theory
