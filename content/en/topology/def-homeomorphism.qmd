# Homeomorphism {#def-homeomorphism}

A **homeomorphism** is a bijective [function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) between [topological spaces](def-topological-space.qmd) that is continuous and has a continuous inverse. It represents the fundamental notion of topological equivalence.

## Formal Definition

Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y, \tau_Y)$ be [topological spaces](def-topological-space.qmd). A function $f: X \to Y$ is a **homeomorphism** if:

1. **Bijection**: $f$ is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto)
2. **Continuous**: $f$ is continuous (for every [open set](def-open-set.qmd) $V \in \tau_Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V) \in \tau_X$)
3. **Continuous inverse**: The inverse function $f^{-1}: Y \to X$ exists and is continuous

## Homeomorphic Spaces

Two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **homeomorphic** if there exists a homeomorphism between them. We denote this as:
$$X \cong Y$$

## Key Properties

### Preservation of Topological Properties

Homeomorphisms preserve all topological properties:
- **Open and closed sets**: $U$ is open in $X$ if and only if $f(U)$ is open in $Y$
- **Connectedness**: $X$ is connected if and only if $Y$ is connected
- **Compactness**: $X$ is compact if and only if $Y$ is compact (see @def-compact)
- **Separation axioms**: $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if $Y$ is Hausdorff (see @def-hausdorff)
- **Convergence**: A sequence converges in $X$ if and only if its image converges in $Y$

### Equivalence Relation

The relation "is homeomorphic to" forms an [equivalence relation](../logic-set-theory/def-equivalence-relation.qmd) on the class of all topological spaces:
- **Reflexive**: $X \cong X$ (the identity map is a homeomorphism)
- **Symmetric**: If $X \cong Y$, then $Y \cong X$
- **Transitive**: If $X \cong Y$ and $Y \cong Z$, then $X \cong Z$

## Examples

### Classic Examples

1. **Open interval and real line**: $(0,1) \cong \mathbb{R}$ via the homeomorphism
   $$f(x) = \tan\left(\pi\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)\right)$$

2. **Circle minus a point and line**: $S^1 \setminus \{p\} \cong \mathbb{R}$ where $S^1$ is the unit circle and $p$ is any point on it

3. **[Open balls](../analysis/def-open-ball.qmd)**: Any two open balls in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are homeomorphic, regardless of their radius or center

4. **Stereographic projection**: The sphere $S^n$ minus a point is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$

### Non-Examples

1. **Closed and open intervals**: $[0,1]$ is not homeomorphic to $(0,1)$ since one is compact and the other is not

2. **Different dimensions**: $\mathbb{R}^m$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $m \neq n$ (requires algebraic topology to prove)

3. **Connected vs disconnected**: A circle $S^1$ is not homeomorphic to two disjoint circles since one is connected and the other is not

## Topological Invariants

Properties preserved by homeomorphisms are called **topological invariants**. These include:
- Number of connected components
- [Fundamental group](def-fundamental-group.qmd) (in algebraic topology)
- Euler characteristic (for suitable spaces)
- Dimension (requires careful definition)

## Intuitive Understanding

Homeomorphic spaces can be thought of as spaces that can be continuously deformed into each other without:
- Tearing or cutting the space apart
- Gluing or identifying previously separate points

This leads to the famous example: a coffee mug and a donut (torus) are homeomorphic because each has exactly one hole.
