# Closed Set {#def-closed-set}

In a [Topological Space](def-topological-space.qmd), a **closed set** is a [Set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) whose complement is an [Open Set](def-open-set.qmd).

## Formal Definition

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space. A subset $C \subseteq X$ is closed if and only if its complement $X \setminus C$ is open (i.e., $X \setminus C \in \tau$).

## Properties of Closed Sets

The collection of closed sets in a topological space $(X, \tau)$ satisfies:

1. **Empty set and whole space**: $\emptyset$ and $X$ are closed
2. **Arbitrary intersections**: The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed
3. **Finite unions**: The union of finitely many closed sets is closed

## Relationship with Open Sets

- A set can be both open and closed (clopen)
- A set can be neither open nor closed
- The closed sets form the dual notion to open sets

## Closure Operator

For any subset $A \subseteq X$, the closure $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$:
$$\overline{A} = \bigcap \{C : A \subseteq C \text{ and } C \text{ is closed}\}$$
