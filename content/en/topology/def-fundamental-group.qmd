# Fundamental Group {#def-fundamental-group}

The **fundamental group** of a [topological space](def-topological-space.qmd) is the [group](../algebra/def-group.qmd) of equivalence classes of loops based at a fixed point, where two loops are considered equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other.

## Formal Definition

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space and $x_0 \in X$ a basepoint. A **loop** based at $x_0$ is a continuous [function](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) $\gamma: [0,1] \to X$ such that $\gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = x_0$.

Two loops $\gamma_0, \gamma_1$ based at $x_0$ are **[homotopic](def-homotopy.qmd)** (written $\gamma_0 \simeq \gamma_1$) if there exists a continuous function $H: [0,1] \times [0,1] \to X$ such that:
- $H(s,0) = \gamma_0(s)$ for all $s \in [0,1]$
- $H(s,1) = \gamma_1(s)$ for all $s \in [0,1]$
- $H(0,t) = H(1,t) = x_0$ for all $t \in [0,1]$

The **fundamental group** $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the set of [equivalence classes](../logic-set-theory/def-equivalence-relation.qmd) of loops based at $x_0$ under [homotopy](def-homotopy.qmd).

## Group Structure

The group operation on $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is given by **concatenation** of loops:

For loops $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ based at $x_0$, their concatenation $\gamma_1 * \gamma_2$ is defined by:

$$(\gamma_1 * \gamma_2)(s) = \begin{cases}
\gamma_1(2s) & \text{if } 0 \leq s \leq 1/2 \\
\gamma_2(2s-1) & \text{if } 1/2 \leq s \leq 1
\end{cases}$$

This operation is well-defined on [homotopy](def-homotopy.qmd) classes and makes $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ into a group with:
- **Identity**: The constant loop $e(s) = x_0$ for all $s \in [0,1]$
- **Inverse**: For a loop $\gamma$, its inverse $\gamma^{-1}(s) = \gamma(1-s)$

## Properties

1. **Topological Invariant**: If $f: X \to Y$ is a [homeomorphism](def-homeomorphism.qmd), then $\pi_1(X, x_0) \cong \pi_1(Y, f(x_0))$

2. **Path-Connected Spaces**: For path-connected spaces, the fundamental group is independent of basepoint up to isomorphism

3. **Simply Connected**: A space $X$ is called **simply connected** if it is path-connected and $\pi_1(X, x_0) = \{e\}$ (the trivial group)

4. **Abelianization**: The abelianization of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is isomorphic to the first homology group $H_1(X)$

## Examples

- $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^n, x_0) = \{e\}$ for all $n \geq 1$
- $\pi_1(S^1, x_0) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, where $S^1$ is the circle (this is the [@free group](../algebra/def-free-group.qmd) on one generator)
- $\pi_1(S^n, x_0) = \{e\}$ for $n \geq 2$, where $S^n$ is the n-sphere
- $\pi_1(T^2, x_0) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, where $T^2$ is the 2-torus
- The figure-eight (wedge of two circles) has $\pi_1 \cong F_2$, the free group on two generators

## Applications

The fundamental group is a powerful tool for:
- Distinguishing non-homeomorphic spaces
- Classifying covering spaces
- Understanding the structure of fiber bundles
- Connecting topology with group theory
