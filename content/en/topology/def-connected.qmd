# Connected Space {#def-connected}

A [Topological Space](def-topological-space.qmd) is **connected** if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty [Open Set](def-open-set.qmd) sets.

## Formal Definition

A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is connected if the only subsets of $X$ that are both open and [Closed Set](def-closed-set.qmd) are $\emptyset$ and $X$ itself.

Equivalently, $X$ is connected if and only if:
- $X$ cannot be written as $X = U \cup V$ where $U, V$ are non-empty, disjoint open sets
- There does not exist a continuous surjection $f: X \to \{0, 1\}$ (with discrete topology)

## Disconnected Spaces

A space is disconnected if it can be written as $X = U \cup V$ where:
- $U, V$ are non-empty
- $U \cap V = \emptyset$
- $U, V$ are both open (or equivalently, both closed)

## Properties

- The continuous image of a connected space is connected
- The closure of a connected set is connected
- If $\{A_i\}$ is a collection of connected sets with $\bigcap A_i \neq \emptyset$, then $\bigcup A_i$ is connected
- A space is connected if and only if every continuous function to $\{0, 1\}$ is constant

## Examples

- The real line $\mathbb{R}$ is connected
- Any interval $[a, b]$, $(a, b)$, $[a, b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is connected
- The space $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ is disconnected

## Path-Connectedness

A stronger notion is **path-connected**: a space where any two points can be joined by a continuous path. Every path-connected space is connected, but not conversely. Path-connectedness is important for the [fundamental group](def-fundamental-group.qmd).


## Formal Proof
