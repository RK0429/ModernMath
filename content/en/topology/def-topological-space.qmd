# Topological Space {#def-topological-space}

A **topological space** is a [Set](../logic-set-theory/def-set.qmd) $X$ together with a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying the following axioms:

## Axioms for a Topology

The collection $\tau$ must satisfy:

1. **Empty set and whole space**: $\emptyset \in \tau$ and $X \in \tau$

2. **Arbitrary unions**: If $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ is any collection of sets in $\tau$, then
   $$\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i \in \tau$$

3. **Finite intersections**: If $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n \in \tau$, then
   $$\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} U_i \in \tau$$

## Terminology

- The collection $\tau$ is called a **topology** on $X$
- The sets in $\tau$ are called **open sets**
- The pair $(X, \tau)$ is called a **topological space**
- When the topology is clear from context, we may simply refer to "the topological space $X$"

## Examples

1. **Discrete topology**: $\tau = \mathcal{P}(X)$ (all subsets are open)
2. **Indiscrete topology**: $\tau = \{\emptyset, X\}$ (only the empty set and $X$ are open)
3. **Standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$**: Open sets are unions of open intervals

## Properties

Key properties that follow from these axioms:

- The union of any collection of open sets is open
- The intersection of finitely many open sets is open
- Complements of open sets are called **closed sets**
