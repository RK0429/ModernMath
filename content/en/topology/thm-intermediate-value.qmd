# Intermediate Value Theorem {#thm-intermediate-value}

A [Continuity](../analysis/def-continuity.qmd) function from a [Connected Space](def-connected.qmd) space to the real numbers attains all intermediate values.

## Statement

Let $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function where $X$ is a connected topological space. If $a, b \in f(X)$ with $a < b$, then for every $c \in (a, b)$, there exists $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = c$.

## Classical Version

For the special case where $X = [a, b] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a closed interval:

If $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $f(a) < c < f(b)$ (or $f(b) < c < f(a)$), then there exists $x_0 \in (a, b)$ such that $f(x_0) = c$.

## Proof Idea

The proof relies on the fact that:
1. The continuous image of a connected space is connected
2. Connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are intervals
3. Intervals contain all intermediate values

## Applications

- Finding roots of continuous functions
- Proving existence of fixed points
- Establishing properties of continuous functions on intervals
- Analysis of differential equations

## Example

Any [polynomial](../algebra/def-polynomial-ring.qmd) of odd degree has at least one real root, since:
- $\lim_{x \to \infty} P(x) = \infty$ and $\lim_{x \to -\infty} P(x) = -\infty$ (or vice versa)
- By IVT, $P(x) = 0$ for some $x$
