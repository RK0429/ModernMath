# Heine-Borel Theorem {#thm-heine-borel}

A subset of Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is [Compact Space](def-compact.qmd) if and only if it is [Closed Set](def-closed-set.qmd) and bounded.

## Statement

For a subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ (with the standard [Metric Space](../geometry/def-metric-space.qmd) topology), the following are equivalent:

1. $K$ is compact
2. $K$ is closed and bounded

where bounded means there exists $M > 0$ such that $\|x\| \leq M$ for all $x \in K$.

## Implications

### Forward Direction
If $K$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then:
- $K$ is closed (since $\mathbb{R}^n$ is Hausdorff)
- $K$ is bounded (by considering the open cover $\{B(0, n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$)

### Reverse Direction
If $K$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $K$ is compact.

## Applications

- Characterizing compact sets in finite-dimensional normed spaces
- Proving existence of extrema for continuous functions
- Establishing convergence of sequences in $\mathbb{R}^n$
