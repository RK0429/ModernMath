# Definition: Open Set {#def-open-set}

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [Topological Space](def-topological-space.qmd). A subset $U \subseteq X$ is called an **open set** if and only if $U \in \tau$.

## Characterization

By the definition of a topology, open sets have the following properties:

1. The empty set $\emptyset$ and the entire space $X$ are open
2. Any union of open sets is open
3. Any finite intersection of open sets is open

## Examples in Common Spaces

### In $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology:
- Open intervals $(a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b\}$ are open sets
- Closed intervals $[a, b]$ are not open sets
- Half-open intervals $[a, b)$ and $(a, b]$ are not open sets
- The entire real line $\mathbb{R}$ is open
- Any union of open intervals is open

### In a discrete space:
- Every subset is an open set

### In an indiscrete space:
- Only $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open sets

## Intuition

Open sets can be thought of as sets where every point has some "wiggle room" around it that stays within the set. This intuition is formalized in metric spaces, where a set is open if every point has an open ball around it contained in the set.
