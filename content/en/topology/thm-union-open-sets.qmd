# Union of Open Sets {#thm-union-open-sets}

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [Topological Space](def-topological-space.qmd). Then the union of any collection of [open sets](def-open-set.qmd) is open.

## Statement

If $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ is any collection of open sets (where $I$ is an arbitrary index set), then
$$\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i \in \tau$$

## Proof

This follows directly from the definition of a topology.

Let $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an arbitrary collection of sets where each $U_i \in \tau$.

By the second axiom in the definition of a [Topological Space](def-topological-space.qmd), the arbitrary union of sets in $\tau$ must also be in $\tau$.

Therefore, $\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i \in \tau$, which means $\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ is open. $\square$

## Important Note

This theorem holds for **arbitrary** unions, including:
- Finite unions
- Countably infinite unions
- Uncountably infinite unions

However, the analogous statement for intersections is **not** true in general. Only **finite** intersections of open sets are guaranteed to be open.

## Examples

1. In $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology:
   - $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} (-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) = (-1, 1)$ is open
   - $\bigcup_{x \in (0,1)} (x - \frac{1}{2}, x + \frac{1}{2}) = (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2})$ is open

2. Counter-example for infinite intersections:
   - $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} (-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) = \{0\}$ is not open in $\mathbb{R}$

## Applications

This property is fundamental in:
- Defining basis and subbasis for topologies
- Constructing new topological spaces
- Proving continuity of functions
