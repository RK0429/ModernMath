# Homotopy {#def-homotopy}

A **homotopy** between two continuous [functions](../logic-set-theory/def-function.qmd) is a [continuous](../analysis/def-continuity.qmd) deformation of one function into the other. This fundamental concept in algebraic topology formalizes the intuitive idea of continuously transforming one map into another.

## Formal Definition

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [topological spaces](def-topological-space.qmd), and let $f, g: X \to Y$ be continuous functions. A **homotopy** from $f$ to $g$ is a continuous function:

$$H: X \times [0,1] \to Y$$

such that:
- $H(x,0) = f(x)$ for all $x \in X$
- $H(x,1) = g(x)$ for all $x \in X$

When such a homotopy exists, we say that $f$ and $g$ are **homotopic**, written $f \simeq g$.

## Intuitive Understanding

Think of the parameter $t \in [0,1]$ as time:
- At time $t = 0$, we have the function $f$
- At time $t = 1$, we have the function $g$
- For intermediate values of $t$, $H(x,t)$ gives the "in-between" function at time $t$

The continuity of $H$ ensures that this deformation from $f$ to $g$ happens smoothly, without any jumps or tears.

## Properties

1. **Equivalence Relation**: Being homotopic is an [equivalence relation](../logic-set-theory/def-equivalence-relation.qmd) on the set of continuous functions from $X$ to $Y$:
   - **Reflexive**: $f \simeq f$ (via $H(x,t) = f(x)$)
   - **Symmetric**: If $f \simeq g$, then $g \simeq f$ (via $H'(x,t) = H(x,1-t)$)
   - **Transitive**: If $f \simeq g$ and $g \simeq h$, then $f \simeq h$

2. **Composition**: If $f_0 \simeq f_1: X \to Y$ and $g_0 \simeq g_1: Y \to Z$, then $g_0 \circ f_0 \simeq g_1 \circ f_1$

3. **Preservation**: Homotopy preserves many topological properties, but is weaker than [homeomorphism](def-homeomorphism.qmd)

## Special Types of Homotopy

### Relative Homotopy

A homotopy $H$ is **relative to a subset** $A \subseteq X$ if $H(a,t) = f(a) = g(a)$ for all $a \in A$ and all $t \in [0,1]$. This means the functions agree on $A$ throughout the deformation.

### Path Homotopy

For paths $\gamma_0, \gamma_1: [0,1] \to Y$ with the same endpoints, a **path homotopy** is a homotopy relative to $\{0,1\}$. This keeps the endpoints fixed during the deformation and is crucial for defining the [fundamental group](def-fundamental-group.qmd).

### Null-homotopic

A map $f: X \to Y$ is **null-homotopic** if it is homotopic to a constant map. That is, there exists $y_0 \in Y$ such that $f \simeq c_{y_0}$ where $c_{y_0}(x) = y_0$ for all $x \in X$.

## Examples

1. **Straight-line Homotopy**: In $\mathbb{R}^n$, any two maps $f,g: X \to \mathbb{R}^n$ are homotopic via:
   $$H(x,t) = (1-t)f(x) + tg(x)$$

2. **Circle Maps**: Two continuous maps $f,g: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$ are homotopic if and only if they have the same winding number around the origin.

3. **Deformation Retract**: A subspace $A \subseteq X$ is a deformation retract if the identity map on $X$ is homotopic to a retraction onto $A$ (relative to $A$).

## Homotopy Equivalence

Two spaces $X$ and $Y$ are **homotopy equivalent** (written $X \simeq Y$) if there exist continuous functions:
- $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$

such that:
- $g \circ f \simeq \text{id}_X$
- $f \circ g \simeq \text{id}_Y$

Homotopy equivalent spaces share many topological invariants, including:
- [Fundamental group](def-fundamental-group.qmd)
- Homology groups
- Cohomology groups

## Applications

Homotopy is fundamental in:
- **Algebraic Topology**: Defining homotopy groups, especially the fundamental group
- **Classification**: Classifying continuous maps and spaces up to homotopy
- **Fixed Point Theory**: The Brouwer fixed-point theorem uses homotopy methods
- **Obstruction Theory**: Determining when continuous maps can be extended or lifted
