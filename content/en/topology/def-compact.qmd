# Compact Space {#def-compact}

A [Topological Space](def-topological-space.qmd) is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover.

## Formal Definition

A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is compact if for every collection $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ of [Open Set](def-open-set.qmd) such that $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$, there exists a finite subset $J \subseteq I$ such that $X = \bigcup_{j \in J} U_j$.

## Equivalent Characterizations

For a topological space $X$, the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is compact
2. Every collection of closed sets with the finite intersection property has non-empty intersection
3. Every net in $X$ has a convergent subnet
4. Every filter on $X$ has a cluster point

## Properties

- Closed subsets of compact spaces are compact
- Compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed
- The continuous image of a compact space is compact
- The product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem)
- Continuous functions on compact metric spaces are [uniformly continuous](../analysis/def-uniform-continuity.qmd) (Heine-Cantor theorem)

## Examples

- Any finite topological space is compact
- The closed interval $[a, b]$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is compact (Heine-Borel theorem)
- The unit sphere $S^n$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is compact
