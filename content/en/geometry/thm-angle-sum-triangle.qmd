title: 'Theorem: Angle Sum of a Triangle'
type: Theorem
---

The sum of the interior [Angles](def-angle.qmd) of any [Triangle](def-triangle.qmd) equals $180°$ (or $\pi$ radians).

## Statement

For any triangle $\triangle ABC$ with interior angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$:
$$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 180°$$

## Proof (Euclidean Geometry)

Given triangle $\triangle ABC$:

1. Through vertex $A$, construct a [Line](def-line.qmd) parallel to side $\overline{BC}$
2. This creates two additional angles adjacent to $\angle BAC$
3. By the parallel postulate and properties of transversals:
   - One angle equals $\angle ABC$ (alternate interior angles)
   - The other equals $\angle BCA$ (alternate interior angles)
4. The three angles at vertex $A$ form a straight angle, summing to $180°$
5. Therefore: $\angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180°$

## Consequences

This theorem has several important implications:

1. **No triangle can have two right angles**: If two angles were $90°$ each, the third would be $0°$
2. **Exterior angle theorem**: An exterior angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles
3. **Classification constraint**: In any triangle, at most one angle can be obtuse

## Generalizations

- In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum is less than $180°$
- In spherical geometry, the angle sum is greater than $180°$
- The difference from $180°$ relates to the curvature of the space

## Applications

- Navigation and surveying
- Determining if three angles can form a triangle
- Solving for unknown angles in geometric problems
- Foundation for trigonometry
