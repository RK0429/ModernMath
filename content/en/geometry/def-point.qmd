A **point** is a primitive notion in geometry that represents a location in space with no dimension (no length, width, or height). In Euclidean geometry, points are the fundamental building blocks from which all other geometric objects are constructed.

## Formal Treatment

In different mathematical contexts, points are formalized differently:

1. **Euclidean Geometry**: Points are undefined primitives satisfying Euclid's axioms
2. **Coordinate Geometry**: A point in $n$-dimensional space is represented as an ordered $n$-tuple $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$
3. **Set-Theoretic**: In [Euclidean Space](def-euclidean-space.qmd), a point is simply an element of $\mathbb{R}^n$

## Notation

Points are typically denoted by capital letters: $A$, $B$, $C$, $P$, $Q$, etc.

## Properties

- Points have position but no size
- Two distinct points determine a unique [Line](def-line.qmd)
- Three non-collinear points determine a unique plane

## Examples

- The origin $(0, 0)$ in the Cartesian plane
- Any element of a [Metric Space](def-metric-space.qmd)
- Vertices of geometric figures like triangles and polygons
