A **triangle** is a polygon with three vertices and three sides. It is one of the fundamental shapes in geometry, formed by connecting three non-collinear [Points](def-point.qmd).

## Formal Definition

A triangle $\triangle ABC$ consists of:
- Three distinct points $A$, $B$, $C$ (vertices) that are not collinear
- Three line segments $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$ (sides)
- Three [Angles](def-angle.qmd) $\angle BAC$, $\angle ABC$, $\angle BCA$ (interior angles)

## Classification

### By Side Lengths
- **Equilateral**: All three sides have equal length
- **Isosceles**: At least two sides have equal length
- **Scalene**: All three sides have different lengths

### By Angles
- **Acute**: All interior angles are less than $90째$
- **Right**: One interior angle equals $90째$
- **Obtuse**: One interior angle is greater than $90째$

## Fundamental Properties

- The sum of interior angles equals $180째$ (see [Angle Sum of a Triangle](thm-angle-sum-triangle.qmd))
- The sum of any two sides is greater than the third side (triangle inequality)
- The area can be calculated using various formulas:
  - Heron's formula: $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$ where $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$
  - Base-height formula: $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$

## Important Elements

- **Centroid**: Intersection of medians
- **Circumcenter**: Center of circumscribed circle
- **Incenter**: Center of inscribed circle
- **Orthocenter**: Intersection of altitudes
