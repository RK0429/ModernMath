An **angle** is the figure formed by two rays (half-lines) that share a common endpoint. The common endpoint is called the **vertex** of the angle, and the two rays are called the **sides** of the angle.

## Formal Definition

An angle can be defined as:

1. **Geometric Definition**: Given three [Points](def-point.qmd) $A$, $B$, $C$ where $A \neq B$ and $C \neq B$, the angle $\angle ABC$ is the union of rays $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$.

2. **Measure Definition**: An angle is associated with a real number called its **measure**, typically expressed in:
   - **Degrees**: A full rotation is $360°$
   - **Radians**: A full rotation is $2\pi$ radians
   - **Gradians**: A full rotation is $400$ gradians

3. **Vector Definition**: The angle $\theta$ between two non-zero vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ is defined by:
   $$\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}}{|\vec{u}||\vec{v}|}$$

## Classification

Angles are classified by their measure:
- **Acute angle**: $0° < \theta < 90°$
- **Right angle**: $\theta = 90°$
- **Obtuse angle**: $90° < \theta < 180°$
- **Straight angle**: $\theta = 180°$
- **Reflex angle**: $180° < \theta < 360°$

## Properties

- The angle measure is invariant under rotation and translation
- In [Euclidean Space](def-euclidean-space.qmd), angles satisfy the angle addition postulate
- Two angles are **congruent** if they have the same measure
- **Complementary angles** sum to $90°$
- **Supplementary angles** sum to $180°$
