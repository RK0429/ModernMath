**Independence** is a fundamental concept in probability theory that formalizes the intuitive notion that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another event.

## Formal Definition

### Independence of Two Events

Two [events](def-event.qmd) $A$ and $B$ in a [probability space](def-probability-space.qmd) are **independent** if and only if:

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$$

Equivalently, when $P(B) > 0$, events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if:

$$P(A|B) = P(A)$$

where $P(A|B)$ is the [conditional probability](def-conditional-probability.qmd) of $A$ given $B$.

### Independence of Multiple Events

A collection of events $\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\}$ is **mutually independent** (or simply **independent**) if for every subset $\{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k\} \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$:

$$P(A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}) = P(A_{i_1}) \cdot P(A_{i_2}) \cdots P(A_{i_k})$$

### Independence of Random Variables

Two [random variables](def-random-variable.qmd) $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if for all measurable sets $A$ and $B$:

$$P(X \in A, Y \in B) = P(X \in A) \cdot P(Y \in B)$$

Equivalently, their joint [distribution](def-probability-distribution.qmd) function factorizes:

$$F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x) \cdot F_Y(y)$$

## Properties

1. **Symmetry**: If $A$ is independent of $B$, then $B$ is independent of $A$

2. **Complement**: If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then:
   - $A$ and $B^c$ are independent
   - $A^c$ and $B$ are independent
   - $A^c$ and $B^c$ are independent

3. **Functions**: If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, then $g(X)$ and $h(Y)$ are independent for any measurable functions $g$ and $h$

4. **Expectation**: For independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ with finite expectations:
   $$E[XY] = E[X] \cdot E[Y]$$

## Important Distinctions

### Pairwise vs Mutual Independence

- **Pairwise independence**: Every pair of events is independent
- **Mutual independence**: The full independence condition holds for all subsets

Mutual independence implies pairwise independence, but the converse is not true.

### Independence vs Disjointness

Independence and disjointness (mutual exclusivity) are different concepts:
- If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint with positive probabilities, they cannot be independent
- If $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$, then $A \cap B = \emptyset$ implies $P(A \cap B) = 0 \neq P(A)P(B)$

## Examples

1. **Coin Tosses**: Successive tosses of a fair coin are independent events
   - $P(\text{Head on 1st toss}) = \frac{1}{2}$
   - $P(\text{Head on 2nd toss}) = \frac{1}{2}$
   - $P(\text{Head on both}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$

2. **Dice Rolls**: Rolling two dice produces independent outcomes
   - Let $A$ = "first die shows 6" and $B$ = "sum is 7"
   - $P(A) = \frac{1}{6}$, $P(B) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$
   - $P(A \cap B) = P(\{(6,1)\}) = \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}$
   - Therefore, $A$ and $B$ are independent

3. **Pairwise but not Mutual Independence**: Consider tossing two fair coins
   - Let $A$ = "first coin is heads"
   - Let $B$ = "second coin is heads"
   - Let $C$ = "both coins show the same face"
   - $A, B, C$ are pairwise independent but not mutually independent

## Applications

Independence is crucial in:
- **Statistical inference**: Assumptions about independent samples
- **Probability calculations**: Simplifying complex probability computations
- **Stochastic processes**: Building models with independent increments
- **Machine learning**: Feature independence assumptions in naive Bayes classifiers
