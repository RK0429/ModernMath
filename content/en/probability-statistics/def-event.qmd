An **event** in probability theory is a [Subset](../logic-set-theory/def-subset.qmd) of the [Sample Space](def-sample-space.qmd) $\Omega$. It represents a collection of outcomes to which a probability can be assigned.

## Formal Definition

Given a sample space $\Omega$, an event $A$ is any subset of $\Omega$:
$$A \subseteq \Omega$$

The collection of all events forms a Ïƒ-algebra (sigma-algebra) $\mathcal{F}$ on $\Omega$.

## Types of Events

1. **Elementary Event**: Contains exactly one outcome
   - Example: $\{3\}$ when rolling a die

2. **Compound Event**: Contains multiple outcomes
   - Example: "Even number" = $\{2, 4, 6\}$ when rolling a die

3. **Certain Event**: The entire sample space $\Omega$
   - Always occurs with probability 1

4. **Impossible Event**: The empty set $\emptyset$
   - Never occurs, has probability 0

## Event Operations

Using set operations from [Union](../logic-set-theory/def-union.qmd) and [Intersection](../logic-set-theory/def-intersection.qmd):

- **Union** $A \cup B$: "A or B occurs"
- **Intersection** $A \cap B$: "Both A and B occur"
- **Complement** $A^c$: "A does not occur"
- **Difference** $A \setminus B$: "A occurs but not B"

## Examples

For a die roll with $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$:
- Event "rolling an even number": $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$
- Event "rolling at least 4": $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$
- $A \cap B = \{4, 6\}$ (even and at least 4)
- $A \cup B = \{2, 4, 5, 6\}$ (even or at least 4)

## Probability of Events

In a [Probability Space](def-probability-space.qmd), each event $A$ is assigned a probability $P(A)$ such that:
- $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
- $P(\Omega) = 1$
- $P(\emptyset) = 0$

## Special Relationships

- **Mutually Exclusive**: Events $A$ and $B$ where $A \cap B = \emptyset$
- **Exhaustive**: Events whose union equals $\Omega$
- **[Independent](def-independence.qmd)**: Events where $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$
