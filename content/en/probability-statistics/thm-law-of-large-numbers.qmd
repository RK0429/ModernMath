# Law of Large Numbers {#thm-law-of-large-numbers}

The **Law of Large Numbers** states that the sample average of [independent](def-independence.qmd) and identically distributed [random variables](def-random-variable.qmd) converges to their [expected value](def-expectation.qmd) as the sample size increases.
