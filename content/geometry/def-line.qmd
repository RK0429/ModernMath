A **line** is a one-dimensional geometric object that extends infinitely in both directions. It is completely determined by any two distinct @def-point[s] that lie on it.

## Formal Definition

In different mathematical contexts:

1. **Euclidean Geometry**: A line is an undefined primitive satisfying Euclid's axioms, particularly:
   - Through any two distinct points, there exists exactly one line
   - A line contains infinitely many points

2. **Coordinate Geometry**: In $\mathbb{R}^2$, a line is the set of all points $(x, y)$ satisfying:
   $$ax + by + c = 0$$
   where $a$, $b$, $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $(a, b) \neq (0, 0)$

3. **Vector Spaces**: A line through point $P$ in direction $\vec{v}$ is:
   $$\ell = \{P + t\vec{v} : t \in \mathbb{R}\}$$

## Properties

- Lines have no thickness or width
- Any two distinct lines in a plane either intersect at exactly one point or are parallel
- In @def-euclidean-space, the shortest path between two points lies along the line connecting them

## Related Concepts

- **Line segment**: The portion of a line between two points
- **Ray**: A half-line starting at a point and extending infinitely in one direction
- **Parallel lines**: Lines in the same plane that never intersect
- **Perpendicular lines**: Lines that intersect at a 90Â° angle
