# Geometry

Welcome to the Geometry section of the Mathematics Knowledge Graph Wiki. This section covers fundamental concepts in geometry, from classical Euclidean geometry to modern differential and algebraic geometry.

## Available Topics

### Core Concepts

- [Metric Space](def-metric-space.qmd) - Spaces with a notion of distance

### Examples

- [Euclidean Space](ex-euclidean-space.qmd) - The standard example of a metric space

## Domain Overview

Geometry studies shapes, sizes, relative positions of figures, and the properties of space. It ranges from the familiar Euclidean geometry to abstract spaces studied in modern mathematics.

## Prerequisites

Topics in geometry often require understanding of:
- Basic set theory
- Linear algebra concepts
- Analysis fundamentals (for differential geometry)

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to browse all geometry topics, or explore the interactive visualizations to see how concepts connect.
