title: 'Definition: Parallel Lines'
type: Definition
---

Two @def-line[s] are **parallel** if they lie in the same plane and do not intersect, no matter how far they are extended.

## Formal Definition

In Euclidean geometry, lines $\ell$ and $m$ are parallel (denoted $\ell \parallel m$) if:
1. They are coplanar (lie in the same plane)
2. They have no @def-point[s] in common: $\ell \cap m = \emptyset$

## Characterizations

### In Coordinate Geometry
Two lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are parallel if and only if they have the same slope:
- Line 1: $y = m_1x + b_1$
- Line 2: $y = m_2x + b_2$
- Parallel iff $m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1 \neq b_2$

### Using Direction Vectors
Lines with direction vectors $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ are parallel iff:
$$\vec{v}_1 = k\vec{v}_2 \text{ for some } k \neq 0$$

## Euclid's Parallel Postulate

The famous fifth postulate states:
> Through a point not on a given line, there exists exactly one line parallel to the given line.

This postulate:
- Cannot be proven from other axioms
- Distinguishes Euclidean from non-Euclidean geometries

## Properties

1. **Reflexivity**: Every line is parallel to itself (by convention)
2. **Symmetry**: If $\ell \parallel m$, then $m \parallel \ell$
3. **Transitivity**: If $\ell \parallel m$ and $m \parallel n$, then $\ell \parallel n$
4. **Equal distance**: Parallel lines maintain constant perpendicular distance

## Parallel Lines and Transversals

When a transversal crosses two parallel lines:
- **Corresponding angles** are equal
- **Alternate interior angles** are equal
- **Co-interior angles** are supplementary (sum to 180°)

## Examples

1. **Railroad tracks**: Classic real-world example of parallel lines
2. **Coordinate axes translations**: $y = 2$ and $y = 5$ are parallel
3. **Opposite sides of a rectangle**: Always parallel by definition

## Non-Euclidean Variations

### Hyperbolic Geometry
Through a point not on a line, there exist infinitely many lines parallel to the given line.

### Spherical Geometry
No parallel lines exist - all great circles intersect.

## Related Concepts

- **Perpendicular lines**: Intersect at 90°
- **Skew lines**: Non-parallel lines in 3D that don't intersect
- **Parallel planes**: Extension to higher dimensions
- **Parallelogram**: Quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel

## Applications

- **Architecture**: Ensuring structural stability
- **Computer graphics**: Ray tracing and collision detection
- **Navigation**: Latitude lines are parallel
- **Linear algebra**: Parallel vectors and subspaces
