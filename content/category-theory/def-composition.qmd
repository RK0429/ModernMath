**Composition** is the fundamental operation in a @def-category that combines two compatible @def-morphism[s] to produce a third morphism.

## Formal Definition

In a category $\mathcal{C}$, given morphisms:
- $f: A \to B$
- $g: B \to C$

Their **composition** is a morphism:
$$g \circ f: A \to C$$

The composition is defined whenever the codomain of $f$ equals the domain of $g$.

## Axioms

Composition must satisfy:

### 1. Associativity
For morphisms $f: A \to B$, $g: B \to C$, $h: C \to D$:
$$(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$$

### 2. Identity Laws
For any morphism $f: A \to B$ and identity morphisms $\text{id}_A$, $\text{id}_B$:
- **Left identity**: $\text{id}_B \circ f = f$
- **Right identity**: $f \circ \text{id}_A = f$

## Notation

Various notations for composition:
- $g \circ f$ (standard, read "g after f")
- $gf$ (shortened form)
- $f;g$ (diagrammatic order, "f then g")
- $fg$ (sometimes used, but can be confusing)

## Examples

### Set Category
In **Set**, morphisms are functions:
- If $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$
- Then $(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$ for all $x \in X$

### Linear Transformations
In the category of vector spaces:
- Morphisms are linear maps
- Composition is matrix multiplication (in finite dimensions)

### Group Homomorphisms
In **Grp** (category of groups):
- If $\phi: G \to H$ and $\psi: H \to K$ are homomorphisms
- $(\psi \circ \phi)(g) = \psi(\phi(g))$ is also a homomorphism

## Properties

1. **Non-commutativity**: Generally $g \circ f \neq f \circ g$
2. **Partial operation**: Not all pairs of morphisms can be composed
3. **Preservation of structure**: Composition preserves the categorical structure

## Commutative Diagrams

Composition is often visualized using commutative diagrams:
```
A ---f---> B
|          |
h          g
|          |
v          v
C ---k---> D
```
This diagram commutes if $k \circ h = g \circ f$
