# Definition: Hausdorff Space {#def-hausdorff}

A @def-topological-space $(X, \tau)$ is called a **Hausdorff space** (or **$T_2$ space**) if for any two distinct points $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$, there exist @def-open-set[open sets] $U, V \in \tau$ such that:

1. $x \in U$
2. $y \in V$  
3. $U \cap V = \emptyset$

In other words, any two distinct points can be "separated" by disjoint open neighborhoods.

## Intuition

The Hausdorff property ensures that points in the space are "distinguishable" from each other using the topology. This is one of the most important separation axioms in topology.

## Properties

- **Uniqueness of limits**: In a Hausdorff space, sequences and nets have at most one limit
- **Closed points**: Every singleton set $\{x\}$ is closed in a Hausdorff space
- **Diagonal property**: A space $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $\Delta = \{(x,x) : x \in X\}$ is closed in $X \times X$ with the product topology

## Examples and Non-Examples

**Examples of Hausdorff spaces:**
- Any metric space (see @thm-metric-hausdorff)
- The real line $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology
- Any discrete space

**Non-examples:**
- The cofinite topology on an infinite set
- The Zariski topology on algebraic varieties (in general)
