# Definition: Complete Metric Space {#def-complete-metric-space}

A @def-metric-space $(X, d)$ is called **complete** if every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges to a @def-limit in $X$.

## Cauchy Sequences

A sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ is called a **Cauchy sequence** if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m, n \geq N$:

$$d(x_m, x_n) < \varepsilon$$

Intuitively, the terms of a Cauchy sequence get arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.

## Relationship to Convergence

- Every convergent sequence is Cauchy
- In a complete metric space, every Cauchy sequence converges
- A metric space is complete if and only if the converse holds: every Cauchy sequence converges

## Examples

**Complete metric spaces:**
- $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard metric (see @ex-real-line-metric)
- $\mathbb{C}$ with the standard metric
- Any closed subset of a complete metric space
- $C[a,b]$ (continuous functions on $[a,b]$) with the supremum metric

**Incomplete metric spaces:**
- $\mathbb{Q}$ with the standard metric (e.g., the sequence $(x_n)$ where $x_n$ is the $n$-th decimal approximation of $\sqrt{2}$ is Cauchy but doesn't converge in $\mathbb{Q}$)
- $(0, 1)$ with the standard metric
- $C[a,b]$ with the $L^1$ metric

## Importance

Completeness is crucial for:
- **Fixed point theorems**: The Banach fixed-point theorem requires completeness
- **Existence theorems**: Many existence results in analysis rely on completeness
- **Construction of $\mathbb{R}$**: The real numbers can be constructed as the completion of $\mathbb{Q}$
