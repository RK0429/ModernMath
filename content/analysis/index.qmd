# Mathematical Analysis

Welcome to the Analysis section of the Mathematics Knowledge Graph Wiki. This section covers fundamental concepts in mathematical analysis, including limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals.

## Available Topics

### Core Concepts

- [Limit](def-limit.qmd) - The fundamental concept of approaching a value
- [Continuity](def-continuity.qmd) - Functions without breaks or jumps

### Important Theorems

- [Arithmetic of Limits](thm-arithmetic-limits.qmd) - Rules for computing limits

### Examples

- [Polynomial Continuity](ex-polynomial-continuity.qmd) - Demonstrating continuity of polynomial functions

## Domain Overview

Analysis forms the foundation of calculus and advanced mathematics. It provides rigorous definitions and proofs for concepts that are often introduced intuitively in calculus courses.

## Prerequisites

Most topics in analysis build upon:
- Basic set theory
- Real number properties
- Function concepts
