# Definition: Derivative {#def-derivative}

The **derivative** of a function at a point measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point. It is defined as a [limit](def-limit.qmd) of difference quotients.

## Definition

Let $f: (a, b) \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in (a, b)$. The derivative of $f$ at $c$, denoted $f'(c)$, is defined as:

$$f'(c) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h}$$

provided this limit exists.

## Alternative Formulation

Equivalently, using a different variable:

$$f'(c) = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c}$$

## Differentiability

A function $f$ is **differentiable at $c$** if $f'(c)$ exists. A function is **differentiable on an interval** if it is differentiable at every point in the interval.

## Notation

Various notations for the derivative include:
- $f'(x)$ (Lagrange notation)
- $\frac{df}{dx}$ or $\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$ (Leibniz notation)
- $Df(x)$ or $D_x f$ (Operator notation)
- $\dot{f}$ (Newton notation, typically for time derivatives)

## Geometric Interpretation

The derivative $f'(c)$ represents:
1. The slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at the point $(c, f(c))$
2. The instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at $x = c$

## Properties

If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then:
1. $f$ is continuous at $c$
2. The tangent line at $(c, f(c))$ has equation: $y - f(c) = f'(c)(x - c)$

## Examples

1. **Constant function**: If $f(x) = k$, then $f'(x) = 0$
2. **Power function**: If $f(x) = x^n$ (n ∈ ℕ), then $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$
3. **Exponential**: If $f(x) = e^x$, then $f'(x) = e^x$
4. **Sine**: If $f(x) = \sin(x)$, then $f'(x) = \cos(x)$
