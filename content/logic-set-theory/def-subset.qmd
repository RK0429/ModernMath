A @def-set $A$ is a **subset** of a set $B$, denoted $A \subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

## Formal Definition

$$A \subseteq B \iff \forall x (x \in A \implies x \in B)$$

In words: $A$ is a subset of $B$ if and only if for all $x$, if $x$ is in $A$, then $x$ is in $B$.

## Notation and Terminology

- $A \subseteq B$: "$A$ is a subset of $B$" or "$A$ is contained in $B$"
- $B \supseteq A$: "$B$ is a superset of $A$" or "$B$ contains $A$"
- $A \subset B$: "$A$ is a proper subset of $B$" (when $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$)
- $A \not\subseteq B$: "$A$ is not a subset of $B$"

## Properties

1. **Reflexivity**: Every set is a subset of itself: $A \subseteq A$
2. **Transitivity**: If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then $A \subseteq C$
3. **Antisymmetry**: If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A = B$
4. **Empty set**: The empty set $\emptyset$ is a subset of every set

## Examples

- $\{1, 2\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$
- $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$
- For any set $A$: $\emptyset \subseteq A \subseteq A$
