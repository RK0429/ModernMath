# Theorem: Cantor's Theorem {#thm-cantor}

For any [set](def-set.qmd) $A$, there is no surjection from $A$ to its [power set](def-power-set.qmd) $\mathcal{P}(A)$. In particular, $|A| < |\mathcal{P}(A)|$.

## Statement

Let $A$ be any set. Then there exists no function $f: A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$ that is surjective (onto).

## Proof

We prove this by contradiction using Cantor's diagonal argument.

Suppose $f: A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$ is surjective. Define the set:
$$B = \{x \in A : x \notin f(x)\}$$

Note that $B \subseteq A$, so $B \in \mathcal{P}(A)$.

Since $f$ is assumed to be surjective, there must exist some $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = B$.

Now we ask: Is $a \in B$?

- If $a \in B$, then by definition of $B$, we have $a \notin f(a) = B$. Contradiction!
- If $a \notin B$, then $a \notin f(a)$, which by definition of $B$ means $a \in B$. Contradiction!

Both cases lead to a contradiction. Therefore, no such surjection $f$ can exist.

## Consequences

1. **Infinite hierarchy**: Starting with any infinite set, we can construct an infinite sequence of sets with strictly increasing cardinalities
2. **No largest cardinal**: There is no set of all sets
3. **Uncountability**: $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable (since $|\mathbb{N}| < |\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})|$)

## Special Case

For finite sets: If $|A| = n$, then $|\mathcal{P}(A)| = 2^n > n$ for all $n \geq 0$.
