# Lagrange's Theorem {#thm-lagrange}

For a finite [Group](def-group.qmd) $G$ and a [Subgroup](def-subgroup.qmd) $H$ of $G$, the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

## Statement

If $G$ is a finite group and $H \leq G$, then:
$$|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]$$

where $|G|$ denotes the order (number of elements) of $G$, and $[G:H]$ is the index of $H$ in $G$ (the number of distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$).

## Corollaries

1. The order of any element $a \in G$ divides the order of $G$
2. If $|G|$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic and has no proper non-trivial subgroups
3. Any group of prime order is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$

## Applications

Lagrange's theorem is fundamental in group theory and has numerous applications:
- Determining possible subgroup structures
- Proving Fermat's Little Theorem
- Classifying groups of small order
