An **identity element** for a @def-binary-operation is an element that leaves any other element unchanged when combined with it.

## Formal Definition

Let $(S, *)$ be a set $S$ with a binary operation $*$. An element $e \in S$ is called:

### Left Identity
If for all $a \in S$:
$$e * a = a$$

### Right Identity
If for all $a \in S$:
$$a * e = a$$

### Two-Sided Identity (or simply Identity)
If $e$ is both a left identity and a right identity.

## Uniqueness

If an identity element exists, it is unique:

**Proof**: Suppose $e$ and $e'$ are both identities. Then:
- $e = e * e'$ (since $e'$ is a right identity)
- $e * e' = e'$ (since $e$ is a left identity)
- Therefore $e = e'$

## Examples

### Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition on $\mathbb{R}$**: Identity is 0, since $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$
- **Multiplication on $\mathbb{R}$**: Identity is 1, since $a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$

### Matrix Operations
- **Matrix addition**: The zero matrix $\mathbf{0}$
- **Matrix multiplication**: The identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ with 1s on diagonal

### Set Operations
- **Union**: The empty set $\emptyset$, since $A \cup \emptyset = A$
- **Intersection**: The universal set $U$, since $A \cap U = A$

### Function Composition
- In the set of functions $f: X \to X$, the identity function $\text{id}_X(x) = x$

## Non-Examples

- **Subtraction on $\mathbb{R}$**: No identity element exists
  - No right identity: $a - e = a$ implies $e = 0$
  - But 0 is not a left identity: $0 - a = -a \neq a$

## Related Concepts

- @def-group: Requires an identity element
- **Monoid**: A set with an associative operation and identity
- **Inverse elements**: Defined relative to an identity element
- @thm-unique-identity: Proves uniqueness in group context

## Properties

1. In a @def-group, every element has an inverse with respect to the identity
2. The identity element is its own inverse: $e * e = e$
3. Identity elements are preserved by homomorphisms between algebraic structures
