# Contributing to the Mathematics Knowledge Graph Wiki

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Mathematics Knowledge Graph Wiki! This project aims to create a comprehensive, interconnected representation of mathematical knowledge. Your contributions help make mathematics more accessible and understandable to everyone.

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

1. **Content Creation**: Write new mathematical concepts (definitions, theorems, examples)
2. **Content Review**: Review and improve existing content
3. **Cross-References**: Add missing links between related concepts
4. **Formal Verification**: Add Lean 4 proofs for mathematical statements
5. **Bug Reports**: Report issues with the website or content
6. **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or improvements

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RK0429/ModernMath.git
   cd ModernMath
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   quarto check
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Content Guidelines

### File Structure

Each mathematical concept should have its own `.qmd` file:
- Definitions: `content/{domain}/def-{concept}.qmd`
- Theorems: `content/{domain}/thm-{theorem-name}.qmd`
- Examples: `content/{domain}/ex-{example-name}.qmd`
- Axioms: `content/{domain}/ax-{axiom-name}.qmd`

### Required Metadata

Every `.qmd` file must include YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Definition: Group"
id: "def-group"
type: "Definition"
status: "draft|complete|verified"
requires:
  - "def-set"
  - "def-binary-operation"
lean_id: "Mathlib.Algebra.Group.Defs.Group" # Optional
---
```

### Content Format

```markdown
# Definition: Group {#def-group}

A **group** is a @def-set $G$ together with a @def-binary-operation...

## Properties

1. **Closure**: For all $a, b \in G$, we have $a \cdot b \in G$
2. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
...

## Examples

- The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition form a group (see @ex-integers-addition)
- The set of $n \times n$ invertible matrices forms a group under multiplication
```

### Cross-Reference Guidelines

Always link to other concepts using the `@` syntax:
- `@def-group` - links to the group definition
- `@thm-lagrange` - links to Lagrange's theorem
- `@ex-integers-addition` - links to an example

**Important**: When mentioning any mathematical concept that has its own page, you must link to it.

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### Building the Knowledge Graph

Before submitting:

1. **Validate Metadata**
   ```bash
   poetry run python scripts/validate_metadata.py
   ```

2. **Build the Graph**
   ```bash
   poetry run python scripts/build_graph.py
   ```

3. **Generate Visualizations**
   ```bash
   poetry run python scripts/generate_pyvis.py
   poetry run python scripts/fix_pyvis_css.py
   ```

4. **Preview Your Changes**
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```

### Code Quality

- Run linting: `poetry run flake8 scripts/`
- Format code: `poetry run black scripts/`
- Type check: `poetry run mypy scripts/`

## ü§ñ Automated Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically:
- Validates all YAML metadata
- Checks for broken cross-references
- Builds the knowledge graph
- Generates visualizations
- Runs an LLM review for missing cross-references

## üìä Mathematical Domains

Content is organized by domain:

| Domain | Directory | Focus Areas |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Algebra | `content/algebra/` | Groups, Rings, Fields, Linear Algebra |
| Analysis | `content/analysis/` | Limits, Derivatives, Integration |
| Topology | `content/topology/` | Topological Spaces, Compactness, Connectedness |
| Geometry | `content/geometry/` | Euclidean, Metric Spaces |
| Number Theory | `content/number-theory/` | Primes, Divisibility |
| Combinatorics | `content/combinatorics/` | Counting, Graph Theory |
| Logic & Set Theory | `content/logic-set-theory/` | Sets, Logic, Foundations |
| Probability & Statistics | `content/probability-statistics/` | Probability Spaces, Distributions |
| Category Theory | `content/category-theory/` | Categories, Functors, Natural Transformations |

## üöÄ Submission Process

1. **Test Your Changes Locally**
   - Ensure all links resolve correctly
   - Verify visualizations generate properly
   - Check that the site builds without errors

2. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add definition of compact space"
   ```

3. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub.

4. **Pull Request Guidelines**
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what you've added/changed
   - Include screenshots if relevant

## üéì Style Guide

### Mathematical Notation

- Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
- Define notation before first use
- Be consistent with standard mathematical conventions

### Writing Style

- Write in clear, accessible language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Provide intuitive explanations alongside formal definitions
- Include examples to illustrate abstract concepts

### Theorem Environments

Use Quarto's theorem environments:

```markdown
::: {.theorem #thm-unique-identity}
**Uniqueness of Identity**

In any group $(G, \cdot)$, the identity element is unique.
:::

::: {.proof}
Suppose $e$ and $e'$ are both identity elements...
:::
```
