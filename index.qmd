# Welcome to the Mathematics Knowledge Graph Wiki

This is an evolving wiki of mathematical knowledge represented as a **knowledge graph**. Our goal is to represent the entire landscape of mathematics as interconnected nodes of **axioms, definitions, theorems, and examples**.

## Features

- **Semantic Knowledge Graph**: All mathematical concepts are connected through formal relationships
- **Cross-Referenced Content**: Navigate between related concepts seamlessly
- **Formal Verification**: Integration with Lean 4 for mathematical rigor
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore the graph structure visually
- **SPARQL Queries**: Query the knowledge graph for complex relationships

## Mathematical Domains

Explore mathematics by domain:

- [Algebra](content/algebra/index.qmd)
- [Analysis](content/analysis/index.qmd)
- [Topology](content/topology/index.qmd)
- [Geometry](content/geometry/index.qmd)
- [Number Theory](content/number-theory/index.qmd)
- [Combinatorics](content/combinatorics/index.qmd)
- [Logic & Set Theory](content/logic-set-theory/index.qmd)
- [Probability & Statistics](content/probability-statistics/index.qmd)
- [Category Theory](content/category-theory/index.qmd)

## Getting Started

Each mathematical concept in this wiki is:

1. Written as a human-readable document
2. Structured with semantic metadata
3. Connected to related concepts through formal relationships
4. Queryable through our knowledge graph interface

## Contributing

This wiki is built using:
- **Quarto** for content authoring
- **RDF/OWL** for semantic representation
- **Python** for graph extraction and processing
- **Lean 4** for formal verification

To contribute, please see our [contribution guidelines](contributing.qmd).

## Query the Knowledge Graph

Coming soon: Interactive query interface for exploring mathematical relationships.
