ultrathink : Please proceed with setting up the Math Knowledge Graph Wiki based on @design_EN/knowledge_graph.md , @design_EN/knowledge_graph_detailed.md , and @plan/knowledge_graph.md .
Do not try to complete many tasks at once; instead, carefully work on each task one by one.
Please reflect the progress of your work in @plan/knowledge_graph.md as you go along.
You can check the deployed website by Playwright or Puppeteer MCP tools.
You can also commit and push the changes by `gh` command or GitHub MCP tools.
