# About the Mathematics Knowledge Graph Wiki

## Vision

This project aims to create a comprehensive, queryable knowledge graph that represents mathematical knowledge as interconnected concepts. By combining human-readable documentation with machine-readable semantic data, we enable both learning and automated reasoning about mathematics.

## Technical Architecture

### Content Layer (Quarto)
- Human-readable mathematical content
- LaTeX equation support
- Cross-referencing system
- Structured metadata in YAML

### Semantic Layer (RDF/OWL)
- Formal ontology defining mathematical concepts
- RDF triples representing relationships
- SPARQL endpoint for querying
- Linked Data publication

### Verification Layer (Lean 4)
- Formal mathematical proofs
- Dependency tracking
- Integration with mathlib4
- Verification of logical consistency

### Visualization Layer
- Interactive graph visualizations
- Dependency diagrams
- Concept maps
- Learning path visualization

## Ontology Structure

Our knowledge graph uses the following core node types:

- **Axiom**: Fundamental assumptions taken as true
- **Definition**: Formal definitions of mathematical concepts
- **Theorem**: Proven mathematical statements (including lemmas, propositions, corollaries)
- **Example**: Concrete instances illustrating concepts

And the following relationships:

- **uses/dependsOn**: Logical dependencies between concepts
- **hasExample**: Links concepts to their examples
- **generalizes/specializes**: Hierarchical relationships
- **implies**: Logical implications

## Development Status
