# GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization Summary

## Improvements Applied to build.yml

### 1. ✅ Concurrency Control

- Added workflow-level concurrency group
- Cancels in-progress runs when new commits are pushed
- **Impact**: Prevents wasted runner time on outdated builds

### 2. ✅ Path Filtering

- Added `paths` and `paths-ignore` filters
- Only triggers on relevant file changes
- **Impact**: Avoids unnecessary builds for documentation-only changes

### 3. ✅ Built-in Poetry Cache

- Replaced manual cache step with `actions/setup-python@v5` built-in cache
- Uses `cache: 'poetry'` parameter
- **Impact**: ~10-15s saved per job, simpler configuration

### 4. ✅ Additional Caching

- Added Quarto cache
- Added Chrome/Puppeteer cache
- **Impact**: Faster subsequent runs

### 5. ✅ Job Parallelization

Split monolithic job into 5 parallel jobs:

- **quality**: Linting and validation (10 min timeout)
- **graph**: Knowledge graph building (15 min timeout)
- **visualizations**: Parallel diagram generation (15 min timeout)
- **site**: Language-specific builds using matrix (20 min timeout)
- **deploy**: Final assembly and deployment (10 min timeout)

### 6. ✅ Visualization Parallelization

- Run Mermaid, PyVis, and D3.js generation concurrently
- Uses background processes with `wait`
- **Impact**: 3x speedup for visualization generation

### 7. ✅ Language Build Matrix

- EN and JA sites build in parallel on separate runners
- Matrix strategy for `[en, ja]`
- **Impact**: ~50% reduction in site rendering time

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before (Single Sequential Job)

- Total time: ~25-30 minutes
- All steps run sequentially
- Single runner doing all work

### After (Parallel Jobs)

- Expected time: ~12-15 minutes
- Multiple runners working concurrently
- Critical path: quality → graph → visualizations → site → deploy

### Resource Efficiency

- Better runner utilization
- Automatic cancellation of outdated builds
- Cached dependencies across jobs
- No builds for documentation-only changes

## Verification Steps

1. Push a code change and verify parallel job execution
2. Push a documentation-only change and verify no build triggers
3. Push multiple commits rapidly and verify older builds are cancelled
4. Check GitHub Actions timeline to confirm parallel execution
