# ModernMath Style Guide Directory

This directory contains detailed authoring guidelines for each type of mathematical content in the ModernMath Knowledge Graph Wiki.

## Content Type Guides

### üìê [Axiom Authoring Guide](axiom-guide.md)

Guidelines for writing axiom pages, including:

- Structure and templates for axioms
- Common mathematical axioms to document (ZFC, Peano, etc.)
- Best practices for foundational assumptions
- Special considerations for controversial axioms

### üìñ [Definition Authoring Guide](definition-guide.md)

Best practices for creating definition pages, including:

- Structure for mathematical definitions
- Prerequisites and dependency management
- Notation guidelines
- Domain-specific considerations

### üìä [Theorem Authoring Guide](theorem-guide.md)

Instructions for theorem, proposition, lemma, and corollary pages:

- Proof writing guidelines
- Statement clarity and prerequisites
- Different proof techniques and structures
- Quality checklist for theorems

### üîç [Example Authoring Guide](example-guide.md)

Guidelines for constructing effective example pages:

- Verification of properties
- Canonical vs. pathological examples
- Counterexamples and edge cases
- Computational examples

## Quick Reference

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **What Makes a Good [Type] Page**: Key principles
2. **Content Structure**: Required sections and organization
3. **File Template**: Complete YAML and content template
4. **Best Practices**: Do's and don'ts
5. **Common Pitfalls**: Mistakes to avoid
6. **Domain-Specific Guidelines**: Special considerations by field
7. **Quality Checklist**: Pre-publication checklist
8. **Examples**: References to well-written pages

## Using These Guides

1. **Choose the appropriate guide** based on the content type you're creating
2. **Follow the template** provided in each guide
3. **Use the quality checklist** before marking content as complete
4. **Study the examples** referenced in each guide
5. **Maintain consistency** with existing content in the same domain

## General Principles

Across all content types:

- Always use `@` syntax for cross-references
- Provide both formal and intuitive understanding
- Include concrete examples where possible
- Maintain consistent notation within domains
- List all prerequisites explicitly
- Follow file naming conventions strictly

For general style guidelines not specific to content type, see the main [Style Guide](../style-guide.md).
