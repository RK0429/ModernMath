# Math Knowledge Graph Wiki - Project Status Report
**Date: January 20, 2025**

## Summary

The Math Knowledge Graph Wiki project has successfully completed Phase 1 (Foundation Setup and MVP) and Phase 2 (Query Infrastructure and Visualization). All core infrastructure components are operational and ready for the next phase of development.

## Current State

### ✅ Infrastructure Status
- **Knowledge Graph**: 48 mathematical content nodes with 276 triples and 80 relationships
- **Fuseki SPARQL Endpoint**: Running and accessible at http://localhost:3030/
- **REST API**: Running at http://localhost:5001/ with full functionality
- **Quarto Site**: Successfully rendered with all content and visualizations

### ✅ Content Coverage
- **Domains**: Algebra, Analysis, Topology, Number Theory, Logic/Set Theory, Geometry, Category Theory, Combinatorics, Probability/Statistics
- **Node Types**:
  - 30 Definitions
  - 11 Theorems
  - 6 Examples
  - 1 Axiom

### ✅ Visualization Types Implemented
1. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Static dependency graphs embedded in each content page
2. **PyVis Interactive**: 58 interactive HTML visualizations with force-directed layouts
3. **D3.js/Observable**: Dynamic visualizations with drag-and-drop and zoom capabilities

### ✅ Documentation Created
- Comprehensive style guide for content authors
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification for REST API
- Deployment guides for GitHub Pages
- Installation guides for Quarto and Java
- Lean 4 integration plan

## Next Immediate Actions

### 1. Install Lean 4 Toolchain
```bash
# Run this command to install Lean 4
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
```

### 2. Create Initial Lean Project
```bash
cd formal/
lake init mathwiki
cd mathwiki/
# Add mathlib4 dependency
```

### 3. Start Basic Formalization
Begin with formalizing these core definitions:
- Set (def-set)
- Binary Operation (def-binary-operation)
- Group (def-group)

## Known Issues

1. **Cross-reference Warnings**: Quarto shows warnings for cross-directory references (e.g., @def-set from algebra to logic-set-theory). These are cosmetic only - the site builds successfully.

2. **Missing Index Pages**: Some domain directories lack index.qmd files (Category Theory, Combinatorics, Number Theory, Probability/Statistics).

## Recommendations

1. **Content Expansion**:
   - Add more examples for existing definitions
   - Expand underrepresented domains (Category Theory has only 2 nodes)
   - Create index pages for all domain directories

2. **Automation Improvements**:
   - Create script to convert @ref syntax to relative paths
   - Add automated content validation to CI/CD
   - Implement LLM-assisted link checking

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider pagination for large graph visualizations
   - Implement caching for SPARQL queries
   - Optimize D3.js rendering for nodes with many connections

## Project Health Metrics

- **Build Time**: ~2 minutes for full Quarto render
- **Graph Generation**: < 1 second for 48 nodes
- **API Response Time**: < 50ms for typical queries
- **Visualization Load Time**: < 2 seconds for interactive graphs

## Conclusion

The Math Knowledge Graph Wiki has a solid foundation with all essential components working correctly. The project is ready to proceed with Phase 3 (Formal Verification and Intelligence) starting with Lean 4 integration. The infrastructure is scalable and can easily support the planned expansion to thousands of mathematical concepts.
